      "message": "We originally decided to keep the roadmap lightweight to lower the barrier to put items on it and to keep the administrative overhead as low as possible. That\u0027s why we didn\u0027t end up with a more complex setup such as tracking all items in an issue tracker. If you now insist on detailed updates, we should reconsider to use an issue tracker.\n\nBy the way, which topics have been done in Gerrit 3.2 should be apparent from the release notes.",
