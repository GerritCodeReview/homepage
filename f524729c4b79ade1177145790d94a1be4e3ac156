      "message": "We have made it part of the experiment, because it is also affecting the Change Log. I guess we could have made two experiments for it, but I think one bigger experiment is nicer.\n\nSo yes, it is activated when the experiment hits you. At this moment the experiment is enabled for 0% of user in canary and 0% in prod. So the also way to actually see the experiment is to explicitly enable it by URL:\n?experiment\u003dUiFeature__cleaner_changelog\n\nBut I was planning to ramp up canary quickly to 100% once this doc is submitted and we have verified that the result looks as expected.\n\nSounds good?",
