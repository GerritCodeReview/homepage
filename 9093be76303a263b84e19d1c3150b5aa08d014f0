I believe you have fully understood the message though.\n\n\u003e It sounds like we\u0027re trying to make Java 11 the default,\n\nYes.\n\n\u003e but will continue to support Java 8 on 3.3 and master for the foreseeable future (since we don\u0027t have a timeline for Google or other company migration to Java 11?)?\n\nYes. We (GerritForge) migrated to Java 11 very easily because we are based on OpenJDK, Docker-based deployments and we don\u0027t have any custom build.\nHowever, other companies made different choices, and some of them have their custom JVM and a special build process.\n\nThe message to the community is: \"Hey, Gerrit v3.3 is *released for Java 11*. However, because we know you still have Java 8, you have one more change to still upgrade to v3.3 and rebuild Gerrit by yourself on Java 8\".\n\nI am happy to amend the message in a different way, can you propose something?",

The confusing part to me was when/if Java 8 is no longer supported and on which branches/releases.\n\nIs it really one last chance? If Google isn\u0027t ready for Java 11+ by 3.4, would we drop Java 8 support? When was Java 11 support first available, 3.2?\n\nFor amendments, maybe s/that means the gerrit.war won\u0027t be able to start on Java 8/that means the prebuilt gerrit.war available on \u003cdownload site\u003e won\u0027t be able to start on Java 8/. And then clarify \"Java 8 will continue to be supported in parallel to Java 11 on v3.3\" and \"There is no change to Java 8 support on 3.1.x and 3.2.x\". Then maybe: \"At some point, hopefully before v3.4, the master branch will drop support for Java 8 (based on Google\u0027s transition timeline)\". (assuming the last bit is true)",
