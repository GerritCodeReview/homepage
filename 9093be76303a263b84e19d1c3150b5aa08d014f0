We (GerritForge) migrated to Java 11 very easily because we are based on OpenJDK, Docker-based deployments and we don\u0027t have any custom build.\nHowever, other companies made different choices, and some of them have their custom JVM and a special build process.\n\nThe message to the community is: \"Hey, Gerrit v3.3 is *released for Java 11*. However, because we know you still have Java 8, you have one more change to still upgrade to v3.3 and rebuild Gerrit by yourself on Java 8\".\n\nI am happy to amend the message in a different way, can you propose something?",
