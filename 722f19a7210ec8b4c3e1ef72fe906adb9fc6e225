      "message": "That link was wrong, updated to point to the code change that this change documents.\n\nThe existing documentation of the prolog fact mentions only a subset of cases. PatchListEntry, which the current implementation is based on, is entirely undocumented. So instead of documenting what has changed, I made sure that the new documentation lists all cases. The new semantics are intuitive (like, a deletion means that the old name is set and the new name is null, which is currently the other way around). I reviewed existing usages and I suspect some of them already rely on the new semantics.",
