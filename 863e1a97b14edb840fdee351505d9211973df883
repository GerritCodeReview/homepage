Posting it anyway to have my opinion on this on the record.\n\nI am in favor of removing \u0027Assignee\u0027 when attention set is added. Attentions set is a more powerful concept that can be used to cater the current use cases of \u0027Assignee\u0027. One of the arguments in favor of assignee is \"there can only be a single one\". We could certainly provide configs or plugin endpoints to have that workflow work on top of attention set.",
