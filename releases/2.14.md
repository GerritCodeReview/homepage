[TOC]

## Release Highlights

* New UI PolyGerrit
* Changes can be assigned to specific users
* HTML emails and new templating framework
* Secondary index with Elastic Search

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Email Templates

This release deprecates the use of Velocity mail templates. It will soon
be necessary to upgrade custom mail templates to Soy files.

## New Features

### User Interface

* To switch to PolyGerrit's UI, append the URL with ?polygerrit=1, to switch back to GWT UI, append
the URL with ?polygerrit=0.

#### Footer links
* The footer now links to PolyGerrit. All you have to do is press the "New UI button" for PolyGerrit
and "Old UI" for the GWT UI.

### Change Assignee

### Emails

Gerrit email messages are made easier to read by sending HTML content parts in
addition to the existing text email content.

Mail templates can now be written using Closure Templates (Soy). Mail templates
written in Velocity (VTL) are deprecated but still supported. Support for VTL
will be dropped in the next release.

### Secondary Index with Elastic Search

## Bugfixes

## Dependency Updates

* Update codemirror to 5.25.0

## Dev tools

* BUCK was replaced with Bazel so this will be a breaking change for everyone that uses buck.
