## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Email Templates

This release deprecates the use of Velocity mail templates. It will soon
be necessary to upgrade custom mail templates to Soy files.

## New Features

### User Interface

* To switch to polygerrit's ui, append the url with ?polygerrit=1, to switch back to gwt ui, append
the url with ?polygerrit=0.

### Change Assignee

### Emails

Gerrit email messages are made easier to read by sending HTML content parts in
addition to the existing text email content.

Mail templates can now be written using Closure Templates (Soy). Mail templates
written in Velocity (VTL) are deprecated but still supported. Support for VTL
will be dropped in the next release.

### Secondary Index with Elastic Search

## Bugfixes

## Dependency Updates
