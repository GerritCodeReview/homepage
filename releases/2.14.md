[TOC]

## Release Highlights

* Secondary index with Elastic Search
* New [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) based user interface
* Support for elliptic curve/ed25519 SSH keys

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Email Templates

This release deprecates the use of Velocity mail templates. It will soon
be necessary to upgrade custom mail templates to Soy files.

## New Features

### Change Assignee

Changes may be assigned to a specific user. This allows a workflow where the
user that is assigned to a change is responsible for reviewing the change and/or
passing the assignment on to another user.

In the UI, changes assigned to the currently logged in user are highlighted.

A new `assignee:` search predicate allows to find changes assigned to a given
user.

### Emails

Gerrit email messages are made easier to read by sending HTML content parts in
addition to the existing text email content.

Mail templates can now be written using Closure Templates (Soy). Mail templates
written in Velocity (VTL) are deprecated but still supported. Support for VTL
will be dropped in the next release.

### Secondary Index with Elastic Search

### New User Interface ("PolyGerrit")

Gerrit now includes a new user interface, referred to as "PolyGerrit", based on
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

The UI can be switched between PolyGerrit and GWT by clicking the "New UI" and
"Old UI" links in the site footer. Alternatively, the UI can be switched by
adding `?polygerrit=1` or `?polygerrit=0` to the URL.

Note that PolyGerrit is still under development. Most use cases are supported,
but there are still some missing features compared to the GWT UI.
