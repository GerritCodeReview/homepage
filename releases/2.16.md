# Gerrit 2.16 *(In development)*

[TOC]

## Release Highlights

* Inline editing support in PolyGerrit UI.

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Support for draft changes removed

Support for draft changes and draft patch sets has been removed. When upgrading
from an earlier version of Gerrit any draft changes, or changes with draft patch
sets, will be migrated to private changes.

A side-effect of this migration is that any merged change that has at least one
draft patch set will be set to private. Change owners can find such changes with
the query `owner:self status:merged is:private` and make them public again using
the "Unmark Private" option in the UI.

### Reindex for new projects index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d site_path
```

Note that it is not necessary to reindex the changes, accounts and groups
indexes offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer
after starting Gerrit.

### Support for Velocity templates removed

In version 2.15 support for Soy templates was added. For backwards compatibility
support for Velocity templates (VTL) was kept.

In version 2.16 support for VTL is completely removed. Site administrators must
replace any Velocity templates (*.vm) with the equivilant Soy templates before
upgrading to this version.
