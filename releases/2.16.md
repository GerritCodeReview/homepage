## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Reindex for new projects index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d site_path
```

Note that it is not necessary to reindex the changes, accounts and groups
indexes offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer
after starting Gerrit.
