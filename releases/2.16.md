## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Reindex for new projects index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d site_path
```

Note that it is not necessary to reindex the changes, accounts and groups
indexes offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer
after starting Gerrit.

### Support for Velocity templates removed

In version 2.15 support for Soy templates was added. For backwards compatibility
support for Velocity templates (VTL) was kept.

In version 2.16 support for VTL is completely removed. Site administrators must
replace any Velocity templates (*.vm) with the equivilant Soy templates before
upgrading to this version.
