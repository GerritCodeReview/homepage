# Gerrit 2.15 *(In development)*

[TOC]

## Release Highlights

* New change workflows for changes not yet ready for full review (formerly Drafts).

* The new PolyGerrit UI is mature enough for most uses.

* Account data is stored in NoteDb.

* NoteDb migration for change metadata is available.

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Release Signatures

Starting with 2.15, all release JARs and documentations are signed by the [Gerrit maintainers](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/releases/public-keys.md).

### New URL Scheme

By default, all Gerrit URLs generated and used by the UI include not just the change number but the project name as well.

* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/1234` becomes `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/c/some/project/+/1234`
* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/#/c/1234` becomes `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/#/c/some/project/+/1234`
* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/changes/1234` becomes `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/some%2Fproject~1234`

In addition to providing more context to humans reading the URL, this new scheme improves performance under NoteDb, and paves the way for load balancing a multi-master installation with repository affinity

Old URLs will continue to be supported, and simply redirect to the new URLs.

### NoteDb

With this release, the new Gerrit storage backend, [NoteDb](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/note-db.html), is officially supported for storing change metadata. Migration to the new backend is optional, and may be done either offline or online in a running server.

The old database storage backend, ReviewDb, will be removed in Gerrit 3.0. Gerrit 3.0 will only support offline migration; to run an online migration, you must use the 2.15.x series.

### Daemon User Setup

The setup documentation now recommends setting up a user named `gerrit` instead of `gerrit2`. This username can be anything; the choice of name doesn't affect any functionality. However, some example commands in the documentation may refer to the new `gerrit` user, so admins might need to tweak them to refer to `gerrit2` instead.

## New Features

### New Workflows

#### Draft, Private, Work-In-Progress

The draft change feature has been removed, and replaced with two separate features:

* [Private changes](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#private-changes) are visible only to the owner and reviewer.
* [Work-in-progress changes](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/user-upload.html#wip) do not generate notifications.

#### Ignore and Mute Changes

Changes can be
[ignored or muted](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#ignore)
to reduce email notifications and keep dashboards cleaner.

#### Explicitly Record Reverted Changes

When a change is reverted via the "Revert" button, this fact is recorded in the change metadata of the newly-created revert change, not just in the commit message as in the past. A new search operator `revertof:` allows for searching for reverts of a given change.

#### Delete Inline Comments

Individual inline comments can be deleted after the fact.

#### CCs Users By Email

Users may be CCed on changes by entering their email address, even if they have not registered an account on the Gerrit server.

This feature is only available when using NoteDb.

#### Publish Comments on Push

When pushing new patch sets on a change or a series of changes, users can configure Gerrit to automatically [publish any pending draft comments](https://http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#publish-comments-on-push) they have on those changes, avoiding the need to click through the web UI to publish all comments.

#### Mark Changes Due to Rebase

When diffing two patch sets of the same change that have different parents, some differences between the patch sets may be due to the rebase, instead of changes between the patch set and its base. These differences are now highlighted in the UI (PolyGerrit only), and are not counted towards the size of diffs.

#### Improved Push Error Messages

When a push fails due to a permissions problem, the generic message `(prohibited by Gerrit)` has been replaced with a detailed message describing the exact permissions required.

### REST API

#### Projects

* [ProjectInfo](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-projects.html#project-info) now contains label configuration information.

#### Changes

* [Mark Private](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#mark-private)

* [Unmark Private](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#unmark-private)

* [ChangeInfo](https://http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#change-info) now records the change that this change was a revert of.

* [Get Pure Revert](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#get-pure-revert)

* [Delete Comment](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#delete-comment)

* [Apply Fix](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#apply-fix)

* [ChangeInfo](https://http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#change-info) now contains the submitter, for merged changes.

#### Groups

* [GroupInfo](https://http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-groups.html#group-info) now contains a `created_on` field.

#### Config

* [Check Consistency](https://http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-config.html#check-consistency)

### API

* New Java API for accessing plugins.

* New Java API for accessing custom project dashbaords.

* New `getGroups` method in account API to get a user's group memberships.

* New `ChangeReportFormatter` extension point for customizing the report output from `git push`.

* Instances of [IdString](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.15/gerrit-extension-api/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/restapi/IdString.java)
  used to return true when `equals` was given a String instance equal to the
  IdString's URL-encoded value. This violates
  [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Definition), so
  this behavior was removed: IdStrings now never compare equal to Strings.
