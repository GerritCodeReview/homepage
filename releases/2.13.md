## Release Highlights

* Support for Large File Storage (LFS)
* Metrics interface
* Hooks plugin
* Secondary index for accounts
* File annotations (blame) in side-by-side diff

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Online Reindexing

To use online reindexing for the `changes` secondary index when upgrading
to 2.13.x, the server must first be upgraded to 2.8 (or 2.9) and then through
2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. Skipping a version will prevent the online reindexer from
working.

Gerrit 2.13 introduces a new secondary index for accounts, and this must be
indexed offline before starting Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index accounts -d site_path
```

If reindexing will be done offline, you may ignore these warnings and upgrade
directly to 2.13.x using the following command that will reindex both `changes`
and `accounts` secondary indexes:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
```

### Hooks Plugin

The server side hooks functionality is moved to a core plugin. Sites
that make use of server side hooks must install this plugin during site init.

## New Features

### Large File Storage (LFS)

Gerrit provides an [extension point](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/2.13/dev-plugins.html#lfs-extension)
that enables development of plugins implementing the
[LFS protocol](https://github.com/github/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api/v1/http-v1-batch.md).

By setting
[`lfs.plugin`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#lfs.plugin)
the administrator can configure the name of the plugin which handles LFS requests.

### Access control for git submodule subscriptions

To prevent potential security breaches as described in
[issue 3311](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3311), it is now
only possible for a project to subscribe to a submodule if the submodule
explicitly allows itself to be subscribed.

Please see the
[submodules user guide](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/user-submodules.html)
for details.

Note that when upgrading from an earlier version of Gerrit, permissions for
any existing subscriptions will be automatically added during the database
schema migration.

### Metrics

Metrics about Gerrit's internal state can be sent to external
monitoring systems.

Plugins can provide implementations of the metrics interface to
report metrics to different monitoring systems. The following
plugins are available:

* [JMX](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-jmx)

* [Graphite](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-graphite)

* [Elastic Search](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/metrics-reporter-elasticsearch)

Plugins can also provide their own metrics.

See the
[metrics documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/metrics.html)
for further details.

### Hooks

Server side hooks are moved to the
[hooks plugin](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/admin/projects/plugins/hooks).
Sites that make use of server side hooks should install this
plugin. After installing the plugin, no additional configuration is needed.
The plugin uses the same configuration settings in `gerrit.config`.

### Secondary Index

* The secondary index now supports indexing of accounts.

  The
  [reindex program](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/pgm-reindex.html)
  by default reindexes all changes and accounts. A new
  option allows to explicitly specify whether to reindex changes or accounts.

  The `suggest.fullTextSearch`, `suggest.fullTextSearchMaxMatches` and
  `suggest.fullTextSearchRefresh` configuration options are removed. Full text
  search is supported by default with the account secondary index.

* New ssh command to
[reindex changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/cmd-index-changes.html).

### User Interface

* The UI can now be loaded in an iFrame by enabling
[`gerrit.canLoadInIFrame`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.canLoadInIFrame)
in the site configuration.

#### Change Screen

* [Issue 106](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=106):
Allow to select merge commit's parent for diff base in change screen.

* [Issue 3035](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3035):
Allow to remove specific votes from a change, while leaving the reviewer on the
change.

* [Issue 3487](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3487):
Use 'Ctrl-Alt-e' instead of 'e' to open edit mode.

#### Diff Screens

* Add all syntax highlighting available in CodeMirror.

* Improve search experience in diff screen.

  Ctrl-F, Ctrl-G and Shift-Ctrl-G now bind to the search dialog box provided by
  CodeMirror's search add-on. Enter and Shift-Enter navigate among the search
  results from the CodeMirror search, just like they do in a normal browser
  search. Esc now clears the search result.

  If the user sets `Render` to `Slow` in the diff preferences and the file is less
  than 4000 lines (huge), then Ctrl-F, Ctrl-G and Shift-Ctrl-G fall back to the
  browser search.

* [Issue 2968](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2968):
Allow to go back to change list by keyboard shortcut from diff screens.

* Blame annotations.

  By enabling
  [`change.allowBlame`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#change.allowBlame),
  blame annotations can be shown in the side-by-side diff
  screen gutter. Clicking the annotation opens the relevant change.

#### User Preferences

* [Issue 989](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=989):
New option to control email notifications.

  Users can now choose between 'Enabled', 'Disabled' and 'CC Me on Comments I Write'.

* New option to control adding 'Signed-off-by' footer in commit message of new changes
created online.

* New option to control auto-indent width in inline editor.

* [Issue 890](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=890):
New diff option to control whether to skip unchanged files when navigating to
the previous or the next file.

### Changes

In order to avoid potentially confusing behavior, when submitting changes in a
batch, submit type rules may not be used to mix submit types on a single branch,
and trying to submit such a batch will fail.

### REST API

#### Accounts

* [Issue 3766](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3766):
Allow users with the
['ModifyAccount' capability](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
to get the preferences for other users via the
[Get User Preferences endpoint](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#get-user-preferences).

* Rename 'Suggest Account' to
['Query Account'](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#query-account)
and add support for arbitrary account queries.

  The `_more_accounts` flag is set on the last result when there are more results
  than the limit. The `DETAILS` and `ALL_EMAILS` options may be set to control
  whether the results should include details (full name, email, username, avatars)
  and all emails, respectively.

* New endpoint:
[Get Watched Projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#get-watched-projects).

* New endpoint:
[Set Watched Projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#set-watched-projects).

* New endpoint:
[Delete Watched Projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-watched-projects).

* New endpoint:
[Get Star Labels from Change](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#get-stars).

* New endpoint:
[Update Star Labels on Change](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#set-stars).

* New endpoint:
[Get OAuth Access Token](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#get-oauth-token).

* New endpoint:
[List Contributor Agreements](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#list-contributor-agreements).

* New endpoint:
[Sign Contributor Agreement](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-accounts.html#sign-contributor-agreement).

#### Changes

* [Issue 3579](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3579):
Append submitted info to ChangeInfo.

* New endpoint:
[Move Change](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-changes.html#move-change).

#### Groups

* Add `-s` as an alias for `--suggest` on the
[Suggest Group endpoint](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-groups.html#suggest-group).

#### Projects

* Add `async` option to the
[Run GC endpoint](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-projects.html#run-gc)
to allow garbage collection to run asynchronously.

* New endpoint:
[List Access Rights](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-projects.html#get-access).

* New endpoint:
[Add, Update and Delete Access Rights](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-projects.html#set-access).

* New endpoint:
[Create Tag](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-projects.html#create-tag).

* New endpoint:
[Get Mergeable Information](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/rest-api-projects.html#get-mergeable-info).

### Plugins

* Secure settings

  Plugins may now store secure settings in `etc/$PLUGIN.secure.config` where they
  will be decoded by the Secure Store implementation.

* Exported dependencies

  Gson is now an exported dependency. Plugins no longer need to explicitly add
  a dependency on it.

### Misc

* New project option to reject implicit merge commits.

  The 'Reject Implicit Merges' option can be enabled to prevent non-merge commits
  from implicitly bringing unwanted changes into a branch. This can happen for
  example when a commit is made based on one branch but is mistakenly pushed to
  another, for example based on `refs/heads/master` but pushed to `refs/for/stable`.

* New
[Add Patch Set capability](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/access-control.html#category_add_patch_set)
to control who is allowed to upload a new patch set to an existing change.

* [Issue 4015](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4015):
Allow setting a
[comment message](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/user-upload.html#message)
when uploading a change.

* Allow to specify
[who should be notified by email](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/user-upload.html#notify)
when uploading a change.

* [Issue 3220](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3220):
Append approval info to every comment-added stream event and hook.

* The `administrateServer` capability can be assigned to groups by setting
[`capability.administrateServer`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#capability.administrateServer)
in the site configuration.

  Configuring this option can be a useful fail-safe to recover a server in the
  event an administrator removed all groups from the `administrateServer`
  capability, or to ensure that specific groups always have administration
  capabilities.

* New configuration options to configure JGit repository cache parameters.

  [core.repositoryCacheCleanupDelay](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#core.repositoryCacheCleanupDelay)
  and [core.repositoryCacheExpireAfter](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/config-gerrit.html#core.repositoryCacheExpireAfter)
  can be configured.

* Accept `-b` as an alias of `--batch` in the
[init program](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.13/pgm-init.html).

## Bugfixes

* Don't add the same SSH key multiple times.

  If an already existing SSH key was added, a duplicate entry was added to the
  list of user's SSH keys.

* Respect the 'Require a valid contributor agreement to upload' setting
when creating changes via the UI.

  If a user had not signed a CLA, it was still possible for them to create a new
  change with the 'Revert' or 'Cherry Pick' button.

* Make Lucene index more stable when being interrupted.

* Don't show the `start` and `idle` columns in the `show-connections`
output when the ssh backend is NIO2.

  The NIO2 backend doesn't provide the start and idle times, and the
  values being displayed were just dummy values. Now these values are
  only displayed for the MINA backend.

* [Issue 4150](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4150):
Deleting a draft inline comment no longer causes the change's `Updated` field to
be bumped.

* [Issue 4099](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4099):
Fix SubmitWholeTopic does not update subscriptions.

* [Issue 3603](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3603):
Fix editing a submodule via inline edit.

* [Issue 4069](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4069):
Fix highlights in scrollbar overview ruler not moved when extending the
displayed area.

* [Issue 3446](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3446):
Respect the `Skip Deleted` diff preference.

* [Issue 3445](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3445):
Respect the `Skip Uncommented` diff preference.

* [Issue 4051](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4051):
Fix empty `From` email header.

* [Issue 3423](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3423):
Fix intraline diff for added spaces.

* [Issue 1867](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=1867):
Remove `no changes made` error case when the only difference between a new
commit and the previous patch set of the change is the committer.

* [Issue 3831](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3831):
Prevent creating groups with the same name as a system group.

* [Issue 3754](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3754):
Fix `View All Accounts` permission to allow accounts REST endpoint to access
email info.

* Make `gitweb.type` default to `disabled` when not explicitly set.

  Previously the behavior was not documented and it would default to type
  `gitweb`. In cases where there was no gitweb config at all, this would
  result in broken links due to `null` being used as the URL.

* [Issue 4488](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4488):
Improve error message when `Change-Id` line is missing in commit message.

  The error message now includes the sha1 of the commit, so that it is
  easier to track down which commit failed validation when multiple commits
  are pushed at the same time.

* Don't check mergeability of draft changes.

  Draft changes can be deleted but not abandoned so there is no way for
  an administrator to get rid of the them on behalf of the users. This can
  become a problem when there many draft changes because the mergeability
  check can be costly.

  The mergeability check is no longer done for draft changes, but will be
  done when the draft change is published.

* Fix internal server error when plugin-provided file history weblink
is null.

  It is valid for a plugin to provide a null weblink, but doing so resulted
  in an internal server error.

## Bugfix Releases

### 2.13.2 {#2.13.2}

* Allow to delete caches if not empty when initializing site during upgrade.

  Caches may be stale during upgrade, so the init program now offers to
  delete them.

  A new `--delete-caches` option is added to allow force delete of all
  caches.

* [Issue 4631](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4631):
Read project watches from database.

  Project watches were being read from the git backend by default, but the
  migration to git is not yet completed.

* [Issue 4632](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4632):
Fix server error when deleting multiple SSH keys from the Web UI.

  Attempting to delete multiple keys in parallel resulted in a lock failure
  when removing the keys from the git backend.

* [Issue 4645](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4645):
Fix malformed account suggestions.

  If the query contained several query terms and one of the query terms was
  a substring of 'strong', the suggestion was malformed.

* Hooks plugin: Fix incorrect value passed to `--change-url` parameter.

  The URL was being generated using the change's Change-Id rather than the
  change number.

* Replication plugin: Fix Guava ProvisionException when replicating from slave.

  for review on `refs/meta/config` by making changes in the project access
  editor and pressing 'Save for Review'.

* Fix server errors in 'Set Access' and 'Get Access' REST enpoints.

* Stability improvements in event dispatch mechanism.
