      "message": "If you think about the replication plugin, we already have plugins generating events. What we don\u0027t have is a plugin that *filters* all events.\n\nWhilst I like the idea a lot (a pluggable event filter?) I believe it\u0027s beyond the scope of this design. The instance-id (or server-name) is something that should be provided by Gerrit and communicated in the event structure.\n\nHowever, Martin I believe yours it is definitely a nice idea for a new design proposal :-)",
