      "message": "What Gerrit version are you experiencing this behavior with?\n\nWith current stable-2.16, particularly with [1] and [2] included, if a weblink is provided to the UI with name being one of \"browse\",\"gitiles\" or \"gitweb\" this weblink will be used as \"inline\" weblink (href for ps and parent SHA1).\nDefault weblink name for gitiles changed with [3] from pluginName (\"gitiles\") to \"browse\". Most installations (including *.googlesource.com I guess) choose to configure gitiles to use the old name since it was well established by then.\n\nPreviously (\u003c 2.16.6) weblinks with linkname \"browse\" where not considered as linking to a code browser by PolyGerrit (which I suspect is because the PG team looked at the *.googlesource.com setups and did not consider the default name \"browse\".\nSo before [2] the gitiles weblink with the default name would be displayed in the \"Links\" collection in the metadata bit of the UI, but after it is considered as linking to a code-browser and will be displayed inline.\n\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/214741\n[2] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/211452\n[3] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/gitiles/+/e4b3a553ac7615c25db6a29badd8d97b254e7bb1%5E%21/",
