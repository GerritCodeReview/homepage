      "message": "This is not accurate. The part, that would save computation is a different setting: \"index.reindexAfterRefUpdate\". When reindexAfterRefUpdate is set to fasle, only then 1k+ changes will no be re-computed. In that case, the mergeable bit becomes stale, in which case it doesn\u0027t make sense to retrieve it, and that why the \"excludeMergeableInChangeInfo\" option was added. Can you re-phrase it so that it is clear what option really saves computation on the server side.",
