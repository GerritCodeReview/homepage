Jujutsu users typically don\u0027t rework existing changes with `git commit --amend` (although that is possible in a colocated repo).

In Jujutsu, the same operations are used to rework a single commit as well as a patch series, and both are fine for the same reason (commit message with Change-Id footer is preserved, change-id header is ignored).",

In that case, a mandatory warning modal could be pretty reliable in letting users know about the situation.\n\nThe configuration option is probably still required, I imagine there are teams who simply don\u0027t _want_ to deal with coworkers playing around with new shiny tools that prevent them from using the tried-and-true ones.\n\nMaybe the system could even be extra smart and detect which users are using Jujutsu already (by the fact that the new changes they upload come with a change-id header). In that case, there\u0027s no need to show a warning modal. But that seems like a luxury feature.",
