Our website is zuul-ci.org because we couldn\u0027t afford to buy zuul.org off of whoever is squatting it.  :(\n\nLess of a nit: Do you want to mention that we\u0027re starting work to implement Zuul for upstream Gerrit?  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d11418  I\u0027m working on that right now. :)",
