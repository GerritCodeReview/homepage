It appears only if you add files during the in-line edit.\n\n\u003e 2. In the same time, we should mention, that on the tip of the stable-2.16 branch the problem was fixed, so there are two options: build gerrit itself or download the most recent release.war from the CI.\n\nThe \"tip of the stable-2.16\" isn\u0027t a release and is subject to change also. Are you sure that isn\u0027t going to break again on the \"tip of a branch\"? We can only mention immutable artifacts here, such as tags and releases.\n\n\u003e 3. Wait with the upgrade from earlier releases, until new 2.16.22 is conducted, in the next days or weeks?\n\nYes, that is what the reader in a nutshell should do: if you really care about that feature, stay on v2.16.18 OR wait.\n\nWDYT?",

I believe that it will be released *soon*, but we don\u0027t have any schedule for EOL releases.\n\nIf anyone needs urgently the latest stable v2.16, the Gerrit-CI would be a good source of download :-)",
