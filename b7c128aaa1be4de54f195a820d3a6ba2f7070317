      "message": "So, I am reading the above and asking how it is helpful to know, that the last 3 released versions are broken? Thanks for telling me, now what? Shouldn\u0027t this also include suggestions what to do?\n\nWe could give three suggestions:\n\n* 1. Looking at the offending CL: [1], it was only included starting from v2.16.19. So, one advice would be to downgrade Gerrit to v2.16.18.\n* 2. In the same time, we should mention, that on the tip of the stable-2.16 branch the problem was fixed, so there are two options: build gerrit itself or download the most recent release.war from the CI.\n* 3. Wait with the upgrade from earlier releases, until new 2.16.22 is conducted, in the next days or weeks?\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/268055",
