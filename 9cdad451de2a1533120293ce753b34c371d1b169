      "message": "I think there was a slight misunderstanding here. When Edwin, Patrick, and I confirmed that a pluggable authentication backend was a good idea, we weren\u0027t thinking of any company goals or interests. We were rather thinking that such an authentication backend would be good for Gerrit from an architectural point of view and that it would nicely complement other customization options of Gerrit.",

      "message": "Actually the implementation was started by Darius, Colby (Google) and me. It was discussed and agreed with Shawn 6 years ago. However, the approach of braking down in changes and merge it failed because it broke the auth system altogether. A new redesign is needed to prevent that happening again. I do suggest to use the new process for reviewing the design of big changes.",
