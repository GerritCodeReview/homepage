It was causing failing requests to load the diff in changes and high CPU usage on the server. The bug was introduced in 2.15.1.",

The bug also only affected diffs between patch sets and among those, only those which had at least one edit due to rebase.\n\nI don\u0027t know whether anybody noticed that, though. The high CPU load was much more obvious.",
