      "message": "It might be worth clarifying (even if you don\u0027t plan to support them all) that there are at least 5 unreviewable update types:\n\n 1) Branch Creation (ref creation + FF from 0)\n 2) Branch FF\n 3) Branch Rewind\n 4) Branch Rewriting (Rewind + FF)\n 5) Branch Deletion (Rewind to 0 + ref deletion)\nDifferentiating these could help point out the desire to potentially need different permissions for FF and rewind, and that rewrites should probably require both?\n\nFootnote: to have feature parity with git, a 6th one might be nice to have someday:\n  6) Branch renaming  (this is not equivalent to a create + delete since git actually renames the reflog when this happens which helps to preserve the history of the ref).",

      "message": "Thinking about the broader picture of a two-person reviewed requirement, I think there\u0027s another important gerrit-specific use case missing, but I think it\u0027s a non-goal in this context. Submodule subscriptions effectively do direct updates and bypass review. A simple solution to that might be to enhance that feature to support creating changes instead of doing direct updates.\n\nSince submodule subscriptions are independent of branch push permissions (as in, I can remove branch push perms and submodule subscriptions continue functioning), I think it\u0027s a non-goal. For that two-person reviewed requirement, it would need a solution.",
