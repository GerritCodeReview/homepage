      "message": "Thinking about the broader picture of a two-person reviewed requirement, I think there\u0027s another important gerrit-specific use case missing, but I think it\u0027s a non-goal in this context. Submodule subscriptions effectively do direct updates and bypass review. A simple solution to that might be to enhance that feature to support creating changes instead of doing direct updates.\n\nSince submodule subscriptions are independent of branch push permissions (as in, I can remove branch push perms and submodule subscriptions continue functioning), I think it\u0027s a non-goal. For that two-person reviewed requirement, it would need a solution.",
