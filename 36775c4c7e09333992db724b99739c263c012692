      "message": "Even if you keep on adding more masters, you won\u0027t solve the concurrency issues on the same repo on NFS.\nAlready with 2 nodes, you have problems when two nodes are reading/writing to the same repo. If you scale up to 10-15-20 or over, the NFS would just become unbearable.\n\nI believe you need to get rid of the shared filesystem if you would like to scale up, including the replication side.\n\nAlternatively, seems obvious, but just buy more powerful hardware. It is not uncommon to see hosts with 512 or more CPUs. That would NOT increase the complexity of the replication plugin (which is WAY too high at the moment) and would be less risky.\n\nHaving said that, your use-case at Qualcomm could be different because your shared NFS, I believe, has caching disabled and directly fire-channel connected to the nodes. But in that case, also, adding more nodes with direct cables could be challenging, unless you add 10-20x network cards to the shared NFS.",
