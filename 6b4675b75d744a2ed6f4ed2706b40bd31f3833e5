The debate is more around how big the net benefit of using assignee together with AS is, not whether there\u0027s any benefits at all.\n\nSince the usefulness of AS is more general (for everyday use) than the usefulness of assignee (which is used in exceptional cases to f.i. to describe urgency), either-or is not really an alternative to removing assignee since it would have the same effect, only with a more complicated implementation.\n\nNot totally analogous but: I could compare it with the option of either submit-button or rebase-button. The choice is simple since you use the submit-button for just about every change you upload, whereas the rebase-button increases the usefulness of Gerrit but you can get by without it.\n\nWe would prefer to have both assignee and AS and I wouldn\u0027t want to choose between them.",
