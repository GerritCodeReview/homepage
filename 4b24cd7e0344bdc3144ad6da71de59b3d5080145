I think however, that this is acceptable.

Although this might be possible.\n\nIdea 1: Do the migration as a onetime event\n- Admin triggers migration (REST/SSH?)\n- Migration will run in the background\n- The migration will activate case insensitivity by committing the changed noteIDs in a single commit and switching auth.userNamesCaseInsensitive to true. These actions should not have a large delay and thus would likely not disrupt any user. However, we would have to make sure that the option is applied without restarting Gerrit.\n- Account reindexing is not strictly required, since the changed note ID should just lead to marking the index entry as stale and reindexing the account on the fly.\n\nIdea 2: Migration is done on the fly during user authentication\n- If a user logs in, authentication is done with the unmigrated note ID, if this note ID doesn\u0027t match the new case insensitive form, it will be migrated. From that time onwards, the user can authenticate case insensitively.\n- This maybe confusing for users and leads to a mix of data, some case sensitive, some case insensitive.\n\nI would prefer idea 1. However, the \"duplicated\" usernames might be an issue here. We would need the toleration mode discussed for the use-case document.

However, teh configuration would have to be reloaded while online. However, the AuthConfig object used to get the configuration, is not yet reloaded with the GerritServerConfig.

This is because one (offline) node already migrated the data, while the online node still has `auth.userNameCaseInsensitive\u003dfalse`. If during that time a user wants to authenticate, Gerrit will complain, that the external ID has the wrong SHA-sum or does not exist at all and will throw an error.
