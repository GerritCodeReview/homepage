      "message": "My suggestion would be:\n\n- At least in the beginning don\u0027t set a limited lifetime, since that is backward compatible and would allow to support the previous format for a while.\n- As mentioned in the design doc, there will be a tool to rewrite the password entries and to set a default expiration time for existing passwords, which can be chosen by the admin.\n- Admins can configure whetehr to allow an unlimited lifetime for tokens at all and if not, what the maximum lifetime would be.\n- Since I am also a fan of security by default, I would suggest that with the update that removes the support for the old format the default should change to allow a maximum lifetime for tokens to be e.g. 90 days. Admins can then still decide to allow an unlimited lifetime.",
