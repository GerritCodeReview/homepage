There is the concern of a single-reviewer workflow being much slower than a multi-reviewer workflow.\n\u003e \n\nI think it was Ben who originally said \"code review is an inherently turn-based system\"?\n\nAs Martin clearly has stated in his solution, nothing there prevents a multi-reviewer workflow. I\u0027m a bit confused why this is being repeated so many times. There is a distinction between \"reviewer\" and \"person with attention\", and it seems that\u0027s being lost in these discussions. Can we please restore it?\n\n\u003e In the end state - as I wrote - I think Martin\u0027s solution would satisfy the use-cases in a similar way as Ben\u0027s solution does.

However, maybe it doesn\u0027t. If it doesn\u0027t, it\u0027s because we learned something new and improved it along the way. To me, that\u0027s going to be a better feature.\n\nWe all know Ben\u0027s solution is heavily influenced by an existing Google-internal solution, but Gerrit isn\u0027t that same internal tool. It may very well have workflows and features that don\u0027t (or didn\u0027t) exist in that tool. Jumping directly to that solution without being able to try out so many of the \"pros\" of the solution, but for much cheaper effort, seems to be doing a disservice to ourselves and our users.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e If that was true (and please tell me if it\u0027s not), process would be the only major difference (apart from many smaller differences).

Martin references some of that detail (e.g. by saying \"F4) Address many of the same \"Deferred Enhancements\" (Expectations, Snoozing...) from Solution 1\").
