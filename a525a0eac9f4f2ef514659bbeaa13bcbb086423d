Could you clarify what is meant by \"inconsistent changes\"?\n\nFor example:\n\n* Does \"inconsistent\" mean the changes are corrupted, such as missing a patch set or having an invalid/missing meta ref?\n* We mention imported changes, but what specifically makes these changes inconsistent?\n\nI think clarifying the above would allow Gerrit admins to understand whether they are affected by this issue.",
