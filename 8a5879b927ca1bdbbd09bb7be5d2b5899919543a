      "message": "I think sending a survey could be a good idea, but as @ekempin@google.com mentions, each item on the roadmap should be assigned to a person/entity.\nNothing wrong with having a list of features requested by the community that people can pick up though.\n\nWe already have a way for people to request features [1], but wonder if the cumbersome process puts people off. I can look into doing a more informal poll and see how that goes.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-design-docs.html#propose",
