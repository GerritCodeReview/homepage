      "message": "Can someone please give me a hint regarding what we are supposed to put in repository config files in order to enable this feature for a particular group?\n\nI suspect that we need to add it to [access \"refs/heads/*\"] section but I have no idea what it is supposed to be the key value.\n\nBased on what I seen so far key names do not have spaces and most of them seam to follow a java naming convention but even after the togle was documented via this change, the key value still seams undocumented.\n\nDocumentation still states \"Toggle Work In Progress state\". thanks",
