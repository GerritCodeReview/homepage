Here are some questions that come to mind:\n\n1) Can we force callers to always provide project+change-number in APIS calls?\n2) Can we just migrate our indices to primaryKey \u003d projectName+changeNumber?\n3) Can we have a setting if new change IDs should be globally unique or per-project unique?\n\nThis way we could migrate our stores/indices and get API callers ready for the change in advance.",
