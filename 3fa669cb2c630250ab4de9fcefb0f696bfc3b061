      "message": "JGit would be the correct place for this IMO. Gerrit\u0027s use of JGit is as simple as calling it\u0027s interfaces. JGit already differentiates between a FileRepository and a DfsRepository. The idea of the Dfs one is that it is distributed to some extent. I think providing your own implementation for a DfsRefDatabase is the way to go. The implementation will be way simpler and more bullet proof because you essentially just provide this one class with a bunch of extra helpers and make sure the biding is correct. You will also avoid any inter-plugin dependency headache.\n\nIf on the other hand, this is implemented as a Gerrit plugin, we\u0027d have to ensure that it is called properly whenever an update is done. So we would create the necessity for calling a plugin endpoint before calling JGit.",
