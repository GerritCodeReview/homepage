      "message": "Interesting!\n\nI think there are two facets to this solution: the mechanism and the user experience. I\u0027ll focus on the UX facet because that fits my usual philosophy best: to start from what we want to help people do and then trace backward from there.\n\nThe UX described here is\n\n* use the Assignee field to determine whose turn it is to act next\n* use bold font in the dashboard to determine which changes are awaiting action\n* use explicit changes to the Assignee to manipulate the state of whose turn it is\n\nA strong advantage is continuity with the existing Gerrit UX. This doesn\u0027t introduce new sections in the change dashboard, new UI constructs for shifting attention, and so on. As a result, it should be straightforward for existing users to adapt to this.\n\nA secondary advantage is that this avoids diffusion of responsibility, since there is only one assignee.\n\nThe main disadvantages I see are\n\n* in multi-reviewer workflows, a single assignee can be too few. For example, if I am an author of a change to Gerrit requiring both Code-Review and Library-Compliance review, I would like both reviewers to get started right away. :)\n* it doesn\u0027t address the overwhelming-dashboard problem. I need to sift through all my incoming and outgoing changes to find the highlighted ones, instead of having a short \"todo\" list on top of changes awaiting my action that I can work through before looking at other incoming and outgoing changes.\n* the interaction between manual and automatic assignee changes is unclear. By contrast, in solution-1, manual changes to who a change is awaiting action by are associated with an explanation in the data model.\n\nA secondary disadvantage is that it takes over the assignee field which people had been using as a strong manual indication of \"I need this person\u0027s help\". I was convinced by the discussion surrounding https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/homepage/+/245069/19#message-d327a4810a875bb0446483772597a9895a93c12d that it makes sense to keep the assignee feature as is on hosts that want it, so that people retain that capability for manual escalation without having a regression introduced by a new feature.",

For example, if I am an author of a change to Gerrit requiring both Code-Review and Library-Compliance review, I would like both reviewers to get started right away. :)\n\nCould you elaborate on why #4 does not address this concern for you?\n\nIf multi-reviewer workflows are important, I suggest adding them to the use-case, I don\u0027t actually see them there. \n\n\u003e it doesn\u0027t address the overwhelming-dashboard problem. I need to sift through all my incoming and outgoing changes to find the highlighted ones, instead of having a short \"todo\" list on top of changes awaiting my action that I can work through before looking at other incoming and outgoing changes.\n\nThe current dashboard already has a section with all the changes assigned to a user. Perhaps you don\u0027t see it (it gets hidden if you don\u0027t have any changes assigned to you)? I\u0027ve updated the solution to additionally move this section to the top of the dashboard.\n\n\u003e the interaction between manual and automatic assignee changes is unclear.\n\nManual changes to assignee\u0027s currently posts a comment recording the assignment change.\n\nI have updated the document to help clarify that automatic changes to the assignee will post comments explaining why someone was assigned to the change.\n\n\u003e By contrast, in solution-1, manual changes to who a change is awaiting action by are associated with an explanation in the data model.\n\nI am not seeing this in the solution-1 perhaps you can point me to this? Perhaps you are referring to the \"Deferred Enhancement: Expectations\"? #5 is intended to address this similarly (hand waving for now).\n\n\u003e A secondary disadvantage is that it takes over the assignee field which people had been using as a strong manual indication of \"I need this person\u0027s help\".

That and anecdotal evidence from interviews suggest that assignee is a special and rather strong signal that only gets used in rather rare instances. It likely grabs extra attention because it is not used that often and teams can even agree on its semantics (which we know at least a few teams do). If we start using it for every change, this property is lost.
