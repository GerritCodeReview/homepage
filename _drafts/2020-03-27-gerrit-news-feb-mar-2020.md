## New plugins home page

A [new page](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/plugins.html) that lists all Gerrit plugins has been
added to the homepage. Beside listing the plugins known to the project, that page shows the current
compatibility status of each plugin towards every supported Gerrit version. The page gets updated at
least daily, which makes its CI build status for each plugin and version fairly current. The page is
reachable from the Code top menu, selecting Plugins.
