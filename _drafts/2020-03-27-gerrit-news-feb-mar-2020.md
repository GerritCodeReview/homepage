## New plugins home page

A [new page](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/plugins.html) that lists all Gerrit plugins has been
added to the homepage. Beside listing the plugins known to the project, that page shows the current
compatibility status of each plugin towards every supported Gerrit version. The page gets updated at
least daily, which makes its CI build status for each plugin and version fairly current.

For each plugin, the known plugin maintainers are also listed. New plugin maintainer candidates are welcome, to help cover unmaintained plugins. Existing maintainer lists could also be augmented, or amended, based on maintainer or community feedback.

This new page is reachable from the Code top menu, selecting Plugins.
