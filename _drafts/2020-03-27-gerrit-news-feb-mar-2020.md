## New plugins home page

A [new page](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/plugins.html) that lists all Gerrit plugins has been
added to the homepage. Beside listing the plugins known to the project, that page shows the current
compatibility status of each plugin towards every supported Gerrit version. The page is rebuilt
everytime the homepage gets redeployed, which usually happens at least once every week. The page is
reachable from the Code top menu.
