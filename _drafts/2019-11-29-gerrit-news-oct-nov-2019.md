## Working Group to deal with plugin community issues

The community managers and the ESC identified community issues with plugins as a
larger topic within the Gerrit community that needs attention. A group of
volunteers formed a
[working group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gerritcodereview-plugin-working-group)
to drive this topic and work on resolving the issues. Anyone is welcome to join
this group and help with getting the work done. Issues that this group is
tackling are collected on a
[hotlist](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q=label%3AHotlist-Plugin-Working-Group)
in Monorail.

The focus of this group is on community issues with plugins (e.g. processes and
best practices around plugins). Specific issues with plugins, extension points
and plugin infrastructure are not in scope.
