      "message": "If you allow multiple assignees (F3), then you are pretty close to my solution, only that you are replacing the assignee feature instead of creating something new. I was told and convinced by others that creating a separate feature is better, because then you can use the existing assignee feature for escalation, and you don\u0027t use the same feature/names for two things that work differently. But personally I don\u0027t have strong feelings about that. I would also be fine with replacing the assignee feature.",

      "message": "I think limiting the attention to at most one reviewer is severely impacting review turn around time and efficiency. While your proposed workflow *can* sometimes be the right approach it does not match my experience that this is what you want 90% of the time. If you want two reviewers to have a look, then why would you prevent the author from assigning to both at the same time? A solution without multiple assignees is missing an important use case IMO.",
