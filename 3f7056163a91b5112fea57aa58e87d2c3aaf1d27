      "message": "If you allow multiple assignees (F3), then you are pretty close to my solution, only that you are replacing the assignee feature instead of creating something new. I was told and convinced by others that creating a separate feature is better, because then you can use the existing assignee feature for escalation, and you don\u0027t use the same feature/names for two things that work differently. But personally I don\u0027t have strong feelings about that. I would also be fine with replacing the assignee feature.",

      "message": "i actually like the multiple levels of attention that would result from going with ben\u0027s proposal, optionally with my modifications:\n- MAY pay attention (loose AS)\n- SHOULD pay attention (strict AS)\n- MUST pay attention (assignee)\n\nassuming a suitable presentation, that\u0027s not confusing at all, and it makes little sense to suggest that the features are competing against each other.",

      "message": "I think limiting the attention to at most one reviewer is severely impacting review turn around time and efficiency. While your proposed workflow *can* sometimes be the right approach it does not match my experience that this is what you want 90% of the time. If you want two reviewers to have a look, then why would you prevent the author from assigning to both at the same time? A solution without multiple assignees is missing an important use case IMO.",

      "message": "this is actually an interesting problem. diffusion of responsibility is a very real phenomenon, and having a strict \"token passing\" mechanism is an effective way to address it from the technical side. however, that solution turns out to be counterproductive when the reviewers are actually eager to act, but just aren\u0027t available all the time - it artificially limits parallelization.\n\nat this point in time i think that going with AS and leaving assignee as a separate feature usable for escalation is probably the better idea.\ni\u0027ll also re-emphasize the need to visualize review activity in real time, which should take away some of the reluctance to act quickly out of concern about pointlessly duplicating other reviewers\u0027 work.",
