      "message": "1) Thanks for the pointer. A secondary use case says: \"As a change owner I want to set expectations about what I want from each reviewer.\"\nI did understand this as multi-reviewer workflow.\n\n2) From an offline discussion with Ben, I heard that there was a plan for this, but that is currently missing from the doc. You are right in suggesting that both proposals lack documented steps for fulfilling this use case. Thanks for clarifying!\n\n3) Ben\u0027s proposal addresses this as \"Snoozed/Paused\": https://www.gerritcodereview.com/design-doc-attention-set-solution-1-workflow.html#deferred-enhancement-snoozingpausing\nIt\u0027s listed as \"deferred enhancement\", so the objective answer to \"Is this present in Ben\u0027s current solution?\" must be \"No\". This is my fault actually, because Ben did include this in his initial proposal as core feature.\nI commented on this early on to gate it on maintainability/implementation complexity: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/homepage/+/245069/1/pages/design-docs/attention-set/solution-1-rules-conditions.md#52\nIt has a high chance of getting done in the initial implementation, but I didn\u0027t want there to be a promise for it. I will update the conclusion with a short statement about that fact to be 100% transparent.",

      "message": "\"If you allow multiple assignees (F3), then you are pretty close to my solution\"\nThis is also the impression I got from reading both proposals. The first part of this proposal is an alternative to Ben\u0027s proposal in singular vs. manifold assignments. From here on, they are closer together. I\u0027ll try to specc\u0027 this out in the conclusion a bit more.\n\n[The following is my opinion as maintainer while other comments try to be objective in comparing what was presented in the two solutions]\n\n\"I was told and convinced by others that creating a separate feature is better, because then you can use the existing assignee feature for escalation\"\nI do have a preference towards making what people see in assignee today (it\u0027s an escalation path to regular reviewers) possible with attention set or simply removing this use-case from Gerrit-long term if the user group that currently uses it finds that \u0027attention set\u0027 is catering their needs. \n\nEssentially assignee is a singular assignment, attention set is a manifold assignment with additional logic. So technically it should be possible to have attention set cater assignee usages. One technical example where we already do this is \u0027reviewer\u0027 which is represented as a state (NONE,CC,REVIEWER). The same thinking could be applied to be in the attention set (NONE,ATTENTION,ESCALATION). The dashboard could show \"Escalated reviews\" at the top.",

While your proposed workflow *can* sometimes be the right approach it does not match my experience that this is what you want 90% of the time. If you want two reviewers to have a look, then why would you prevent the author from assigning to both at the same time? A solution without multiple assignees is missing an important use case IMO.",

      "message": "this is actually an interesting problem. diffusion of responsibility is a very real phenomenon, and having a strict \"token passing\" mechanism is an effective way to address it from the technical side. however, that solution turns out to be counterproductive when the reviewers are actually eager to act, but just aren\u0027t available all the time - it artificially limits parallelization.\n\nat this point in time i think that going with AS and leaving assignee as a separate feature usable for escalation is probably the better idea.\ni\u0027ll also re-emphasize the need to visualize review activity in real time, which should take away some of the reluctance to act quickly out of concern about pointlessly duplicating other reviewers\u0027 work.",
