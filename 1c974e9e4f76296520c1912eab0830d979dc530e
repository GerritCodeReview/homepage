Maybe something like this would be better:\n\n\"Many questions regarding Gerrit concerns are a direct result of local environment and configuration. Often such issues have already been discussed on the repo-discuss mailing list and you may find an answer by searching through the existing posts. If you have a new question, you can start a new discussion thread. Via the mailing list you can reach Gerrit experts in the our world wide community and benefit from their collective knowledge.\"",
