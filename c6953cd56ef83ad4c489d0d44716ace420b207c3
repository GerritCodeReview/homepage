Beyond 7.10, yes, we\u0027d probably look at the Amazon fork or whatever else the community thought was a good option.\n\n\u003e We\u0027d need at least another user for there to be an argument that it should be in core.\n\nIs the suggestion then that ElasticSearch support be moved to a plugin? Maybe we need a maintainers discussion?\n\nJust to share a bit more here, one consideration we have for the index backend is which will give us the most accurate search results with many writes in a multi-primary setup. We haven\u0027t really started the analysis there, but from the little bit we\u0027ve looked at with ES vs HA-plugin, ES seems to allow for better support.",
