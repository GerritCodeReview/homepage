      "message": "I believe the request from the community was to have:\n- guaranteed response times, based on the priority of the problem\n- commitment to provide a solution and a fix\n\nThe two above points are covered by the Enterprise Support, which is provided by GerritForge for a fee, as discussed during the last ESC.\n\nI agree with you that the details can be left to the GerritForge web-site, without having to duplicate them here.\n\nWhat do you think about:\n- Reducing the entire paragraph to just L154-163\n- Link to GerritForge web site for more details\n\nDoes the above make sense to you?",
