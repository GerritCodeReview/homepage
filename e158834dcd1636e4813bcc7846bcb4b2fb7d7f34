      "message": "I disagree that \"sub-checks\" are a solution.  They are an existing problem in that there are checkers which run multiple units of work as part of a check.  I call them sub-checks here to align terminology with both the current system and prior design discussions around the checks plugin.\n\nPerhaps if I modified the first paragraph of this use-case document to to read as follows, it would be more clear:\n\n  Some checkers may run multiple units of work (some call these \"jobs\",\n  we will call them \"sub-checks\" in this document) as part of a single\n  check.  Users may wish to be able to see the individual results and\n  log links for these units of work as conveniently as they do now with\n  checks themselves.\n\nWould that address your concern?",

      "message": "You say \"related checks\" here, and I\u0027m interested in that. Does this problem include the problem of wanting to have checks that depend on other checks?\n\nFrom what I now know of Zuul (thanks Monty!) and what you have in the background below, I think that use case you have in mind would be a CI system running a single check then providing information about other checks which were not pre-defined. What about the case where you define in advance a sub-check? This is a case we often have at $DAYJOB as for example, there are some checks which are more expensive to run than others and it doesn\u0027t make sense to do them unless \"prerequisite checks\" have completed successfully.",
