## Engineering Steering Committee Meeting, Nov 2, 2022

Han-Wen Nienhuys, Patrick Hiesel, Luca Milanesio, Saša Živkov

### Next meeting

Dec 14, 2022

### Import of projects

Luca gave an overview of challanges faced when importing Gerrit projects.
That includes server ID mismatches and change number clashes. The topic
of portability of projects seems interesting to the wider audience, so
the desire was for a design doc to be written.

### Dedeprecation of change numbers

We discussed if integer change numbers should be dedeprecated. This will
be clarified as part of the design doc on project imports.
