## Working Group to deal with plugin community issues

The community managers and the ESC identified community issues with plugins as a
larger topic within the Gerrit community that needs attention. A group of
volunteers formed a
[working group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gerritcodereview-plugin-working-group)
to drive this topic and work on resolving the issues. Anyone is welcome to join
this group and help with getting the work done. Issues that this group is
tackling are collected on a hotlist in Monorail.

The focus of this group is on community issues with plugins (e.g. processes and
best practices around plugins). Specific issues with plugins, extension points
and plugin infrastructure are not in scope.

## Hackathon and User Summit in Sunnyvale

GerritForge hosted a hackathon from the 11th to 15th November and a User Summit on the
16th and 17th in Sunnyvale, California.

Luca's report of the summit is [in progress](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/homepage/+/246605)
and will be published separately.

## Gerrit 3.1.0 Released

During the hackathon in Sunnyvale, Gerrit version 3.1.0 was released. This version
includes the long-awaited support for git protocol V2, and the PolyGerrit UI is
upgraded to use Polymer 2.

See the [release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.1.html) for full details.

## Gerrit Roadmap

The Engineering Steering Committee has published a tentative
[roadmap](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/roadmap.html) for the project. The
roadmap defines features to be included in the next release (version 3.2.0) and
in future releases.
