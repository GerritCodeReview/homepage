## Community Management work done

We, [community managers](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/members.html#community-managers),
wanted to share what we think we accomplished during this ending term. Here is
a humble summary of those items, with links for the detailed evidence `;)` -Our
goal with sharing this list is to close the year transparently and happily:

1. For the first time in Gerrit, a
   [Community backlog](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q=component%3ACommunity&sort=priority)
   was initialized to structure and do the work.
1. A first formal Gerrit community Retrospective was conducted, which led to
   [shared actions](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q=label%3ARetrospective&sort=priority).
1. That goal of actively listening to us community helped Google conclude their
   [Survey](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q=label%3ASurvey&sort=priority).
1. Contributions to the first Gerrit
   [governance process](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-processes.html#project-governance),
   we hope, helped pave that whole way above.
1. The companion
   [Contribution process](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-community.html#how-to-contribute)
   started similarly, or so we intended; design docs to the rescue!
1. With such community roles, contributions and design reviews came the need for a
   [Code of Conduct](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html).
1. A new
   [plugins status](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2020-03-31-gerrit-news-feb-mar-2020.html#new-plugins-home-page)
   home page emerged, also thanks to core maintainers and ESC contributions.

Until the next upcoming term unfolds then `:)`
