The Google Gerrit UX team will be joining the Gerrit User Summit in Sunnyvale
on November 16 and 17, 2019. We've been working hard on improving checks
integration and making it easier to know whose turn it is when reviewing a
change in Gerrit. Please join us at our booth in the breakout space to give
us feedback and share your insights. There will also be a [lightning talk](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2019/+/master/lightning-talks/google-gerrit-ux.md)
that introduces the team as well as our work. We are looking forward to many
interesting conversations!
