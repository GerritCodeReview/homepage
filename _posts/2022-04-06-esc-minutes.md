### Next meeting

May 5, 2022

## Cleaning up CLAs

We have many different groups on gerrit-review.googlesource.com that
are used to signal that users have acknowledged the contributors
license agreement (CLA). We are cleaning these up.

## Release cut

[Change 326953](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/326953)
needs to be submitted before the release reached rc-3 to be contained.

This release brings submit requirements and we need to make sure all flags
are set correctly. We'll make these changes before the release gets out.
