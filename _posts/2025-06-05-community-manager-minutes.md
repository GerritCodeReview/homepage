# Gerrit Community Managers Meeting, June 6th, 2025

**Participants**: Daniele Sassoli, Nasser Grainawi, Matthias Sohn

## Gerrit User Summit Call For Papers

CFP is progressing slowly. Despite the overall good attendance at GerritMeets
events, this highlights a trend of low community engagement when it comes to
presenting, with speakers mainly coming from a select few companies.

Suggestions are welcome on how we make more contributors feel comfortable in
sharing their experiences and what incentives could be used, if any.

## Reducing spam on both issue tracker and gerrit.googlesource

The issue tracker has now been locked down to limit the amount of spam users on
it. Membership of [repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss) is
now required in order to report issues.

We hope this will greatly help in keeping the issue tracker more relevant.

## ESC and CM elections

The nomination phase of the election of non-Google ESC and CM members for
2025-2026 is now closed. There was a delay in getting the vote casting process
started, this is now ongoing and will end on the 10th of June, after which we'll
announce the new members on the mailing list.
