## Engineering Steering Committee Meeting, Oct 12, 2022

Han-Wen Nienhuys, Luca Milanesio, Christophe Pouchet, Saša Živkov

### Open vs. closed default settings

The default config grants `read` permission on `refs/heads/*`, which
is practical for development and testing, but not a secure default for
production use. Consensus that more secure defaults would be good;
this could take the form of a init question, "do you want default open
/ default close" setting?

### Gerrit 3.7 release

Gerrit RC 0 and RC 1 are out. Luca could asks for help writing release notes.

### Gerrit user summit/hackathon

Finding space was hard; end of the pandemic caused a space crunch. Due
to space constraints, no open call for participation to the hackathon.
Summit is almost fully booked. Google and SAP will give talks on
recent work.


### Community updates

The move to Discord from Slack has gotten positive feedback.

The new format for the community meeting (solicit a specific topic,
discussion on that topic) has garnered a lively discussion in the last
meeting.
