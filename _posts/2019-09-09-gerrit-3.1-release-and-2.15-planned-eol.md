## Release plan for 3.1

During the [last ESC meeting](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2019-09-03-esc-minutes.html)
it was decided that we will aim to release Gerrit 3.1 during the upcoming hackathon
in Sunnyvale in November 2019.

The tentative plan is to cut the `stable-3.1` branch a few weeks before the hackathon,
i.e. around mid-October, so that there is enough time to make release candidates
and stabilize it before the release.

## End Of Life for 2.15

Per the support policy mentioned on the [project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/#support),
after 3.1 is released 2.15 will reach end of life and will no longer be actively
supported. Support for 2.16 and 3.0 will continue; users of 2.15 or earlier are
recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
