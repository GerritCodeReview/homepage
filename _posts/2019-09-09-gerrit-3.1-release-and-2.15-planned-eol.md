During the [last ESC meeting](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2019-09-03-esc-minutes.html)
it was decided that we will aim to release Gerrit 3.1 during the upcoming hackathon
in Sunnyvale in November 2019.

Per the support policy mentioned on the [project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/#support),
this means that 2.15 will reach end of life and will no longer be actively supported.
