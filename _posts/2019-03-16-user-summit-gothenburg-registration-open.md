Registration for Gerrit User Summit 2019 is now open on
[gus2019.eventbrite.com](https://gus2019.eventbrite.com).

You can request also the participation to the Hackathon in the form. If you are a
maintainer, your request is automatically accepted. For all the other requests, we
will allocate slots for contributors and even for all of those who never contributed
to Gerrit but are willing to learn and start extending and using Gerrit API.
