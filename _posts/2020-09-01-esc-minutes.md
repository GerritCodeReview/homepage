## Minutes

### CI Results Tab and Composable Submit Rules

Ben and Patrick have met with all interested stakeholders and the
feedback loop is closing this week. Luca will take a final look at
both docs on Friday and approve if no major blockers surface until
then.

### Roadmap

We discussed if the roadmap should include generic items or rather
be very specific. Recent discussions have shown that if it's too
specfic adding items triggers discussions that already anticipate
discussions that would usually happen on design docs ("how" and
"why" not "what"). This seemingly discourages contributors from
adding items to the roadmap, which is not what we want.

The roadmap will therefore stay generic and contributors should feel
encouraged to add plans they have.

Items can be backed by tracking bugs if the owner wants that.

### Gerrit 3.3

We discussed plans for the 3.3 release and are targetting a release
in November with branches being cut in October. Luca will drive the
release. Google will check if there are internal resources to support
this effort, which was unclear at the time of the meeting.

### New maintainership

The nomination for a new maintainer is progressing well and will
conclude on Thursday.

### Open designs

Besides the CI results tab and Composable Submit Rules, we discussed
deletion of groups. Alice volunteered to write a conclusion. The feature
should be implemented in a plugin so that the auditability of groups
remains intact in core.
