## Minutes

### Action items

Google has published quarterly objectives for Q3

### Virtual summit Dec 2-3

There were no user summits for 2 years. Gerritforge would like to
organize a user-event. As the pandemic isn't under control yet, a
face-to-face event is unlikely.

(Both Google and SAP have WFH arrangements. We cannot and don't want
to send people to a f2f event.)

A user-event attracts more participants, so will need infrastructure
beyond Google meet. Gerritforge can hire an external company.
