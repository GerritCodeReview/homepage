# Gerrit Community Update: November 2025
This update covers key discussions, events, and future planning points discussed
by the Gerrit community team, reflecting recent activities and upcoming
initiatives.

## GerritMeets Munich: Successful Turnout and great to be back at Google
Yesterday saw the latest instalment of GerritMeets event in Munich, which was a
great success, drawing an excellent crowd of over 70 attendees for a productive
day of community collaboration and technical discussion.

Many thanks to GDG Cloud Munich organizers, Florian Haubner and Mike Annau from
Google for helping us organise and supporting the event!

## Project & Community Engagement
A major highlight was the return of official presentations from Google, marking
the first time in a few years they have actively participated. This presence
was highly welcomed and signals a strong internal interest in the Gerrit project's
ongoing development, as also demonstrated by the growing number of commits in
Gerrit 3.13.

In terms of leadership, community members Dani, Matthias, and Luca connected
with Ivo, the new manager of the Gerrit team. This introductory meeting was
positive, and the community looks forward to a fruitful collaboration as the
project progresses.

## Technical Insight: The MCP Server
The technical agenda featured strong sessions, notably the presentation on the
MCP server, which was extremely well-received. The technology demonstration
prompted an insightful community discussion.

Dani also suggested that it would be nice if the MCP server would learn some SSH
commands to provide further functionalities.

## FOSDEM Attendance
Sadly, this time round we did not manage to organize in time, we'll target
attending with a Gerrit stand in 2027.

## Project Updates

### Website Redesign
Dani will try to abstract the plain english from the HTML pages to YML files.

### Project Logo (Diffy)
We're still discussing this, likely Luca will start a poll in the coming weeks.
