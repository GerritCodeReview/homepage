## In-Person Meet-ups are back

After the success of the 2023 Gerrit Hackathon and Summit and with COVID era
restrictions having been lifted for a while the community managers are glad to
announce that, as announced during the Summit, we will start organizing
in-person meetups, sponsored by [GerritForge](https:gerritforge.com), in the Silicon Valley.

The intention behind this is to get the Gerrit community back together so we
can thrive off of each other's knowledge and experiences.
Each meet-up will host a set of short talks with the intention of exploring
in-depth common problems in the life of us Gerrit Admins and Users.

The first meetup will see two 20 minutes talks, details can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/gerritmeets/events/296847753/).
Going forward, it would be great to host these at different venues so if you're happy
to host a friendly group of Gerrit Users/Admins please reach out to [yolanda@gerritforge.com](mailto:yolanda@gerritforge.com).
Equally, if you're interested in speaking at future events do reach out as we'd love to
hear what you have to share.


This will be hosted in GerritForge's Sunnyvale office, located in the
[Historic Del Monte building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TrL4VNpJtfV49v1J7) at:
100 S Murphy Ave STE 200,
Sunnyvale,
CA 94086

There is a good amount of parking immediately next to the building and an
overflow just across the street and also by Sunnyvale station.

It will be held over lunch on November the 15th, starting at 11:45 and running until 12:45, so come
and join us, we'll have plenty of pizza and Swag to share, like Gerrit branded
bottles and t-shirts.

Please register at the [event](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/gerritmeets/events/296847753/)'s page if you're planning to attend, as places
are limited.

We're excited to see you all there.

Senior Engineering Manager @ GerritForge
