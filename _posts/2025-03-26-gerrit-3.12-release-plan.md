## Gerrit Hackathon

There isn't any Gerrit hackathon planned before the stable-3.12 branch cut; however,
there is a [`gerrit-3_12-release` Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/775374026587373568/1353333423636348968)
dedicated to anyone willing to help with the development, test and documentation
of this release.

## Switch to Java 21

Gerrit v3.12 has dropped support for Java 17, Java 21 is mandatory and
set as target source-code level.

## End-to-end Testing

We plan to use the
[Gatling e2e test framework for Git](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html),
developed by GerritForge and Ericsson, to test the stability of the release
on a production-like setup on AWS automatically provisioned using the
[aws-gerrit](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/aws-gerrit) and
[k8s-gerrit](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/k8s-gerrit) deployments.

[GerritForge](https://www.gerritforge.com), who is also offering
[Gerrit-as-a-Service on Google Cloud Marketplace](https://gerritforge.com/gaas.html),
will be testing the scalability of Gerrit v3.12, particularly with
medium to large sized projects and in a multi-primary setup with Kubernetes.

## End of Life for Gerrit 3.9.x

Per the support policy mentioned on the
[project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/support.html#supported-versions),
after 3.12.0 is released 3.9.x will reach end of life and will no longer be
actively supported.

Support for 3.10.x and 3.11.x will continue as usual.
Users of 3.9.x or earlier are recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
