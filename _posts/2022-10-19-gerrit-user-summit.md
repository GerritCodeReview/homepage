The Gerrit User Summit is finally back, face to face!

After two years of remote meetings and virtual conferences, this year, we are back face-to-face at
[CodeNode](https://www.codenode.live/) in the heart of the vibrant City of London.

**The dates are:**
- Nov 7th to 9th – Hackathon
- Nov 10th to 11th – User Summit

We had many challenges in securing the location, but we finally managed and we
will be able again to get in touch and network with the rest of the community.

## Event home page

There is a [Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon home page](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2022/+/refs/heads/master/index.md)
where you can get all the information about the event and the full schedule.

## How to register

### Hackathon, 7-9 November

The hackathon is running mainly remote, because of the lack of space in the shared
office space in London.

On-site in London there will 10 members between maintainers and major contributors,
connected remotely with the rest of the community through the
[Discord event](https://discord.gg/BYBECqT8?event=1027503668041363517).

### On-The Summit, 10-11 November

**Attending face to face in London**

The CodeNode space allows up to 50 attendees on-site, due to the need to having extra
space and ventilation. We are already over 80% complete, so *hurry up* to secure one
of the last seats available!

The event is FREE and you can register on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gerrit-user-summit-2022-tickets-424995963367)

**Attending remotely**

The whole Gerrit community can attend the Summit also remotely with a live broadcasting
on the internet. **There is no need to register** to attend the live stream event
broadcasting. The link and the instructions on how to join will be posted to the
[repo-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss) by 7 November.

See you next month in London and remotely on Discord!
