## Engineering Steering Committee Meeting, Sep 14, 2022

Han-Wen Nienhuys, Luca Milanesio, Christophe Pouchet, Saša Živkov

### Next meeting

Oct 5, 2022

### Proposal of a Gerrit User Summit 2022 face-to-face in London

Based on the feedback of the Gerrit User Summit 2021, [GerritForge](https://www.gerritforge.com)
proposed to have a Gerrit User Summit face-to-face again in London
at [CodeNode](https://www.codenode.live/).

The format would be similar to the [Summit in 2019](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2019/+/0747f3d79531be2939602e19611b1b8d8ed6e083/schedule-usa.md)
in Sunnyvale CA, where an AV streaming channel will allow people
to attend and participate remotely.

SAP and Google will attend and present at the Summit but only remotely.

### Gerrit v3.7 release plan draft

The release plan for Gerrit v3.7 has been shared, and there
consensus that it can go ahead with the review and approval.

Google is focusing on closing down the in-flight features on master,
GerritForge will be finalising the features for rendering
changes imported as refs from other Gerrit setups, which would help the
[JGit project](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/) in moving their repositories to GerritHub.io.

Luca will bump the JGit version on Gerrit master ASAP, so that it
can be tested on the ground before starting the stable-3.7 branch.

### Public sector use of Gerrit

Luca shared the research done about the use of open-source in the UK:
- [General guidance on the approach to open-source for UK Digital Services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/be-open-and-use-open-source)
- [MoJ open positions for SCM admins with Gerrit experience](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/4443)

The two above resources give evidence that Gerrit is used in the UK
and the [Government Digital Services](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
encourage the use of open-source in developing their platform.
