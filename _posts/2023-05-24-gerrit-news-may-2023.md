## Issue Tracker Migration done

Gerrit issues, including issue history, have been migrated into the new
[Gerrit Code Review Tracker](issues.gerritcodereview.com).

You can learn more about the new issue tracker's features at:
[developers.google.com/issue-tracker](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker)

The [Gerrit project in Monorail](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit) is still
available in read-only mode so that links to issues in Monorail are still
working. Each Monorail issue has a banner now that informs about the new issue
location.

New issues can be filed in the new tracker now:

* [WebFrontend Issue](TODO)
* [Bug Report](TODO)
* [Feature Request](TODO)
* [Security Issue](TODO)
* [GoogleSource Issue](TODO)
* [GerritHub Issue](TODO)
* [Community Issue](TODO)
* [Repo Tool Issue](TODO)
