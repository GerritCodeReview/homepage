## Gerrit Hackathon

The Gerrit hackathon is planned before the stable-3.11 branch cut, from
the 7th to the 8th of October at Qualcomm in San Diego (CA), focused on the
[JGit multi-pack index support](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2024/+/refs/heads/master/lightning-talks/hackathon-midx-outcome.md).

## End-to-end Testing

We plan to use the
[Gatling e2e test framework for Git](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html),
developed by GerritForge and Ericsson, to test the stability of the release
on a production-like setup on AWS automatically provisioned using the
[aws-gerrit](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/aws-gerrit) and
[k8s-gerrit](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/k8s-gerrit) deployments.

[GerritForge](https://www.gerritforge.com) has also offered its own AWS
infrastructure to test the scalability of Gerrit v3.11, particularly with
medium to large sized projects and in a multi-primary setup and will also
use its Google Cloud infrastructure to test Gerrit v3.11 with K8s.

The [Gerrit-CI](https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com) has also an automated
[aws-gerrit pipeline](https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com/job/gatling-gerrit-test/)
that will be pointed to the stable-3.11 branch and run on a daily basis.

## End of Life for Gerrit 3.8.x

Per the support policy mentioned on the
[project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/support.html#supported-versions),
after 3.11.0 is released 3.8.x will reach end of life and will no longer be
actively supported.

Support for 3.9.x and 3.10.x will continue as usual.
Users of 3.8.x or earlier are recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
