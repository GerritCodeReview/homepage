Gerrit 3.1.0 was released yesterday (14th November 2019), which means that
per the support policy mentioned on the [project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/#support),
Gerrit 2.15 has reached end of life and will no longer be actively
supported.

Support for 2.16 and 3.0 will continue; users of 2.15 or earlier are
recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
