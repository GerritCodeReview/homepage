## Community Management work done

See the [dedicated news post](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2020-04-22-community-managers-report.html).

## Cherry-picking topics

By using the same cherry-pick button on a change with a topic, it is
now possible to cherry-pick the entire topic. All that's required to
cherry-pick an entire topic is to specify the destination branch.

The limitations in this versions are the requirements to pick only
one destination branch to all changes in the topic, and that it is
not possible to cherry-pick a topic that has multiple changes in the
same repository and branch.

## ESC and CM elections

The Engineering Steering Committee and Community Managers elections
[have been completed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/repo-discuss/zHCT2IowQng/huv-6NsbAgAJ).
These were to elect members for the non-Google positions. The Google
positions were also confirmed alongside. The resulting elected and
Google positions, for both ESC and Community Managers, remain the
[same as the previous mandates](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/members.html).
