## Project Governance

Edwin Kempin (Google) led an effort to define a clear governance model for the
project, with the following goals:

1. Have clear project governance rules, including a steering committee
   for decision making.
2. Establish a new contribution process for large/complex features that
   requires to write a design doc first.
3. Offer mentorships to make contributions easier and faster, and raise
   the quality of new features.
4. Appoint a community manager, who focuses on the health of the
   Gerrit community and constantly improves community processes.

Several [documentation changes](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/hashtag:proposal-for-better-collaboration)
were reviewed, and face-to-face discussions were held among the community,
before the new process documentation was approved and submitted during the
Munich hackathon.

The new documentation is hosted on gerrit-review.googlesource.com
[here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-community.html),
and work is ongoing to update the project homepage with related information.

## Hackathon in Munich

From 13 to 17 May,
[around 20 core developers and maintainers](https://twitter.com/DevilJackj/status/1129287522297810944)
from Google, GerritForge, CollabNet, SAP, Ericsson and Axis gathered
for a hackathon at the Google office in Munich.

The major achievements during the hackathon were:

* Gerrit version 3.0.0 was finalized and released
* The new community governance process was finalized
* The new checks plugin was integrated with GerritForge CI

Changes created during the hackathon can be found on gerrit-review with
the
[muc-2019 hashtag](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/hashtag:muc-2019).

## Dave Borowitz leaves the project

Shortly before the Munich hackathon Dave Borowitz
[announced](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/ySP84Q0DHsw)
that he will leave the project to move on to another opportunity within Google.

## Community Calendar

Edwin Kempin created a
[public calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=google.com_ubb1pla6ij785oqbjr61h4vdis@group.calendar.google.com)
which will contain community events like user summits and hackathons.
In future we will likely also create calendar entries for upcoming releases etc.
