## Issue Tracker Migration done

Gerrit issues, including issue history, have been migrated into the new
[Gerrit Code Review Tracker](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues?q=status:open).

New issues can be filed at https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/new

You can learn more about the new issue tracker's features at:
[developers.google.com/issue-tracker](https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker)

The Monorail issues are read-only now. Accessing a Monorail issue automatically
redirects to the issue in the new tracker. You can still access the issues in
Monorail by appending "&no\_tracker\_redirect" to the URL (e.g.
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=15057&no\_tracker\_redirect).

announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss/c/F4havFh_Bvw/m/D5MsV17yAgAJ).
