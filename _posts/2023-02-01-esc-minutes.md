Christophe Pouchet, Han-Wen Nienhuys, Patrick Hiesel, Luca Milanesio, Saša Živkov

### Next meeting

Mar 1, 2023

### Gerrit User Summit 2023

Volvo cars proposed to host the Gerrit User Summit 2023 in Gothenburg (Sweden)
in late summer or beginning of September. They have already hosted the event
in 2019 with great success.

Luca will send a survey to understand how many people may be potentially interested
in joining the Summit either onsite or online.

GerritForge also is looking at the possible locations, considering
also Florence (Italy) as a possible option for 2024.

### Draft release plan for Gerrit v3.8

Luca presented the initial [Gerrit Code Review v3.8 release plan](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/homepage/+/357074)
which would target mid-may as potential release date.

Google is looking at the availability of meeting rooms in Munich (Germany)
for potentially having some of the maintainers onsite during the release
week.
