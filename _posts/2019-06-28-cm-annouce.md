## Gerrit Community Managers formally announced for the 2019 term

We are now introducing ourselves as your [Community Managers](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/members.html#community-managers) for Gerrit in 2019:

* Edwin (Google),
* Marco (Ericsson) and
* Matthias (SAP).

Minutes of our regular trio meetups (when newsworthy) [started being posted](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2019-06-05-cm-minutes.html).

### Community Backlog

* We use a transparent backlog for that role of ours [under the Community component](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list?q=component:Community).
* Community members may submit new items under that component for us managers to refine.
* Only public topics should be issued through that backlog.

### Confidential Group

* Sensitive topics are to be privately discussed using [this mailing list](mailto:gerritcodereview-community-managers@googlegroups.com).
* This is a group that remains private between the individual community member and us managers.
* Everyone is welcome to confidentially share feedback with us three that way.
* This group and the Community backlog are being added to the Gerrit documentation now.

### Community Survey

* We invite you/every Gerrit community member to fill our [first community survey](https://forms.gle/bQGMQt6SAUNh8BJP8) out.
* We need your input to help feed the community retrospective scheduled for the [2019 Gerrit Summit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2019-06-18-user-summit-sunnyvale-registration-open.html) in Gothenburg.
* Your individual answers remain anonymous and will stay private to us community managers.
* Answers are accepted between now and July 2019 included.
* Thanks for your feedback! :)
