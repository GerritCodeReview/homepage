## In-Person Meet-ups are back

After the success of the 2023 Gerrit Hackathon and Summit and with covid era
restrictions having been lifted for a while the community managers are glad to
announce that, as announced during the Summit, we will start organizing
in-person meetups, sponsored by GerritForge, in the Silicon Valley.

The intention behind this is to get the Gerrit community back together so we
can thrive off of each other's knowledge and experiences.
Each meet-up will host a set of short talks with the intention of exploring
in-depth common problems in the life of us Gerrit Admins and Users.

The first meetup will see two 15 minutes talks, the call-for-paper for which is
now open and can be found at the following page <insert link>.

This will be hosted in GerritForge's Sunnyvale office, located in the 
Historic Del Monte building at: 
100 S Murphy Ave STE 200, 
Sunnyvale, 
CA 94086

It will be held over lunch, starting at 11:45 and running until 13:00, so come
and join us, we'll have plenty of pizza to share.

The event will also be streamed via Zoom, link will follow at the event's page,
however the pizzas won't.

Please register at the event's page if you're planning to attend, as places
are limited.

We're excited to see you all there.
