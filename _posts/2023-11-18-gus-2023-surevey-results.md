# What is the opinion about the Summit?

A survey was sent to all of the attendees on both locations and even though
there was a 30% response rate in USA and 17% in Sweden we delved into the
details, and these are the comments received:

### Q1: How would you rate the Gerrit User Summit 2023 edition?

![GUS 2023 - Rate - Sweden](images/sweden.png "GUS 2023 - Rate - Sweden")
![GUS 2023 - Rate - USA](images/usa.png "GUS 2023 - Rate - USA")

While in USA, 9% of the respondents rated their experience at a 10, 55% rated it
at a 9 and 36% gave an 8; in Sweden the great majority rated it with an 8. Where
10 was the highest positive rate, this feedback gives an idea of how satisfied
attendees were in general with the User Summit. Understanding individual experiences
and perceptions allows us to evaluate the event and identify areas for improvement.

### Q2: What did you like the most about the 2023 Summit?

Attendees in California were thoroughly impressed with the talks at the event
and appreciated the valuable networking opportunities. On the other hand,
Gothenburg attendees raved about the fantastic space and location of the venue.
They found the off-camera discussions, presentations, and Q&A sessions
incredibly interesting and enjoyable. Thought the use of Slido for questions was
highly effective, giving attendees ample time to contemplate and engage with the
speakers.

They also loved hearing organizations share their stories and the
collaborative atmosphere for creating new design documents and proof-of-concept
code. The attendees were left with the impression that the event brought
together a multitude of talented individuals who delivered engaging talks. The
event left high expectations for upcoming features and created an enthusiastic,
positive atmosphere.They truly valued the chance to engage with fellow attendees
and found the experience rewarding.

### Q3: What did you not like about the 2023 Summit?

Attendees from both locations expressed their concern about the division of the
summit into two locations and time zones, which made it challenging to connect
with the entire group. While the idea of having simultaneous locations was
appreciated, attendees in Gothenburg felt disadvantaged as they were unable to
ask live questions to presenters due to the time difference with the USA. It was
recommended not to repeat this approach in future events. However, overall, the
attendees had a positive experience at the summit. They expressed their wish for
Google to attend and highlighted a missing feature in Slide that would allow for
the separation of topics in questions.

Some attendees preferred the event to be held on weekdays rather than weekends,
as it affected their personal time.
Additionally, they expressed a preference for more user/project-driven success
stories, as opposed to focusing solely on development and administrative topics.
Some attendees also noted that there was a lack of diversity in the companies
present. In Gothenburg in particular, they suggested choosing a venue with less
noise for dinner to facilitate networking. Lastly, it was reported that the
attendance felt to be relatively low in both locations. Evaluating the factors,
will allow us more chances of a higher participation in the next Summit.

### Q4: What was your main objective in attending the Summit?

The attendees had two main objectives in mind: learning and networking. Going
into further detail, they expressed various specific goals, including sharing
research findings and enticing potential industrial partnerships. They were also
keen on staying updated with the latest developments in the Gerrit ecosystem and
gaining insights into how Gerrit is utilized within the community. Meeting
people face-to-face was highly valued, as it provided a more personal and direct
means of communication compared to email or Discord. Additionally, attendees
wished to actively participate in the open-source Gerrit community and discover
new directions for the product. Some mentioned that they were excited about the
opportunity to listen to James Blair. For some attendees, the event offered a
chance to reconnect with Gerrit after a period of absence. Some emphasized in
the fact that fostering a positive open-source software community was a shared
aspiration, alongside the desire to learn about how organizations utilize Gerrit
in their processes. Overall, the attendees were motivated to make the most of
the event, seeking knowledge exchange and valuable connections.

### Q5: Do you consider to have achieved the objective?

A decisive 100% said to have achieved their goal by attending the Summit.

# Reactivating the Gerrit community

Given the initiative to create a group of periodic in-person meetings ([GerritMeets](https://www.meetup.com/gerritmeets/))
to revive the community in the Bay Area (CA), in-person attendees at the summit in
Sunnyvale, CA, were asked about their topics of interest, if they would attend
in person, remotely live or watch the recorded content afterwards, and if they
would participate by giving a talk.

Respondents agreed 100% that they would be willing to give a talk. They differed
in the mode of attendance, as opinions were evenly divided between attending in
person, joining remotely via live streaming, and accessing the recorded content
after the meetup. The suggested topics were:

['How to write a scripting plugin in Gerrit'](https://youtu.be/_Pcx_aMyZVw?si=yU2peuHHcKmuIeYZ),
'Getting started with pull-replication and multi-site', 'Research on code review'.

The invitation to these periodic meetings was extended to the global community
and when asked for topics of interest, the topic 'Hacking' was added.

# What's next for 2024?

* GerritMeets will start every month in 2024, from February. GerritMeets is periodic
in-person meetup in the Bay Area, with the intention to live stream, so the global
community can join as listener as well as with a talk, so everybody can learn & share
knowledge and experience.

* With Gerrit [3.9 been released](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.9.html) in
November 2023, 2024 will be the year of Gerrit 3.10, in May, and 3.11, in November.

* Gerrit User Summit will be back in September 2024 with more interesting talks
from the community

A genuine thank you goes out to all the participants and presenters who made the
