## Code of Conduct published

The [community managers](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/members.html#community-managers)
for Gerrit have just published a [code of conduct](https://gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html)
for the project and associated events.

### For every community member

Every Gerrit community member is encouraged to become aware of the contents
of that [Code](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html).

The latter includes [directives](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html#conflict-resolution)
on how to anonymously report code violations, should any arise eventually.

### Tailored for Gerrit

The code clarifies what the project standards are in detail, as well as
how potential conflicts may be resolved.

The code is a careful adaption of a few yet authoritative codes, all
[mentioned as references](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html#attribution).

### Your feedback

Community member feedback about the [Code](https://gerritcodereview.com/codeofconduct.html)
or anything Gerrit is always welcome.

Please share either [publicly](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/support.html#general-support)
or [privately through community managers](mailto:gerritcodereview-community-managers@googlegroups.com)
if needed.
