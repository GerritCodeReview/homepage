## Change Acceptance Policy for the Stable Branch

We don't expect that all ongoing feature development will be completed before
the stable branch is created, so we will allow further development to continue
on the stable branch to bring features to completion *until `rc3`*.

After `rc3` only bug fixes will be accepted on the stable branch.

We would prefer that bug fixes are pushed for review directly onto the stable
branch, rather than onto master to be cherry-picked back. The reason for this
is to avoid that the release managers need to spend time checking which changes
need to be backported.

## "Release Week"

We had initially planned to finalize and make the release during the Spring
hackathon, but that has been cancelled due to the ongoing situation with COVID-19.

Instead, we will ask any community members who would have joined the hackathon
to allocate some time during the "release week" (25-29 April) to be able to help
with activities to finalize the release:

- triage incoming bug reports
- make fixes
- do code reviews
- test the latest head of the stable branch

In particular, we would like Google to make some members available to handle
reviews of Library-Compliance and frontend changes. We will also ask Matthias
to be available if necessary to help with JGit related issues.

We will set up a dedicated channel on [Slack](https://gerritcodereview.slack.com/)
where these activities will be coordinated. It is yet to be confirmed if we will
set up any kind of video or voice conferences.

## End-to-end Testing

We plan to use the E2E test framework developed by GerritForge to verify the
stability of the release.

## End of Life for Gerrit 2.16.x

Per the support policy mentioned on the [project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/#support),
after 3.2.0 is released 2.16.x will reach end of life and will no longer be
actively supported. Support for 3.1.x and 3.0.x will continue; users of 2.16.x
or earlier are recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
