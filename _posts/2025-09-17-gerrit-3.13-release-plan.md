## Gerrit Hackathon

There are no official plans for Gerrit hackathon, however, the maintainers
attending the [Gerrit User Summit 2025, 17-19 October](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/a/schedule/#)
will be able to get together and work side-by-side at the release
during the event.

## End-to-end Testing

We plan to use the
[Gatling e2e test framework for Git](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html),
developed by GerritForge and Ericsson to test the stability of the release
on a production-like setup.

[GerritForge](https://www.gerritforge.com), who is also offering
[Gerrit-as-a-Service on Google Cloud Marketplace](https://gerritforge.com/gaas.html),
will be testing the scalability of Gerrit v3.13, particularly with
medium to large-sized projects and in a multi-primary setup with Kubernetes
on GKE.

## End of Life for Gerrit 3.10.x

Per the support policy mentioned in the
[project homepage](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/support.html#supported-versions),
after 3.13.0 is released, 3.10.x will reach the end of life and will no
longer be actively supported.

Support for 3.11.x and 3.12.x will continue as usual.
Users of 3.10.x or earlier are recommended to upgrade to one of these versions.
