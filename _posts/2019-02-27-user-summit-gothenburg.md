## Intro
The Gerrit Community, with the collaboration of Volvo Cars and GerritForge, is happy to
announce the Gerrit User Summit & Hackathon 2019.

For those who are not familiar with it, it is THE event of the year for everything related
to Gerrit Code Review and the trunk-based development pipeline.

Where: Volvo Cars HQ in Gothenburg (Sweden)
When: 29-30th August 2019

## The Event

The event will start with a 5-days Hackathon 24-28th August reserved for the current Gerrit
contributors and maintainers plus anyone that is willing to start contributing to the platform.
It will then follow with a 2-days summit 29-30th August opened to anyone that is contributing,
using or is planning to adopt Gerrit Code Review in their development process.

## Registration

Registration for Gerrit User Summit 2019 will be opened in a few weeks on
[eventbrite.com](https://eventbrite.com). Keep watching the mailing list to secure your space
as soon as the registration form is released.

There are 30 seats available for the Hackathon (by invitation) and 70 seats available for the Summit.

## About the summit

The Gerrit User Summit is the place where all of the major Gerrit users annually meet and exchange
experiences and practices that foster the community with new and useful ideas. Gerrit experts,
continuous delivery thought leaders and companies at the User Summit would help to shape the
future of Gerrit.

You can participate actively and ask to talk about your story on adopting and using Gerrit in
your organization.

The Gerrit Call for Papers will be opened shortly and, if you are interested in speaking, you will
be able to submit your talk proposal and have the entire community vote for it.

Start booking the window in your calendar and keep an eye on the mailing list and on
Twitter [@gerritreview](https://twitter.com/gerritreview) for any updates.

Thanks again to Volvo Cars for making this happen and to GerritForge for contributing to the event.
