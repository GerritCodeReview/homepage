      "message": "I am trying to ensure that the problem description stands on its own and is well described, understood, and agreed upon before offering solutions. As a community we noticed that as positive engineers, we tend to talk about solutions and often forget to describe the objective/problem and scope. This doc is intended to not have solutions. I will upload a follow on change with a proposal for a solution, and maybe someone else will have a solution.",

However, the design is far from being perfect, so I do agree that a redesign is needed and I am happy to contribute.",
