Very much appreciated!\n\nI think this doc has reached a state where we can submit it as the first version. \n\nFor everyone who is not familiar with the Gerrit design doc process [1], submitting a solution doesn\u0027t mean that it has been accepted. Accepting a solution is done via the `conclusion.md` doc (that is still empty). This requires a  discussion in the engineering steering committee (ESC).\n\nAfter this change has been submitted everyone is welcome to upload iterative improvements to the doc or suggest alternative solutions.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-design-docs.html",
