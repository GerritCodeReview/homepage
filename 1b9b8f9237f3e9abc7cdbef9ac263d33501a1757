I would trust the author that when substantial changes are made then they would manually remove the positive votes and ask for another round of review. FWIW, Google internally we always trust and even copy positive votes for all code changes. I would love to do that in Gerrit, as well, if we could restrict this rule to only apply for maintainers.

Maybe that\u0027s doable by a Prolog rule, but we don\u0027t like to add new Prolog rules.\n\nI agree with Ben that copying the votes is useful for design docs, and I think we can trust authors to remove votes if significant changes to a design are done (we would need to write down this rule in the documentation that describes the design doc review process). If anyone misuses this, we can just revert the commit.",
