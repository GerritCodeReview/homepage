It is true that do not contain code; however, they do contain the design of the code which could be even more important than the code itself.\n\nOut of topic: we should introduce a way to \"detect\" the trivial changes (white-spaces etc) and implement a copyPositiveScoreOnTrivialChange feature :-)",

I would trust the author that when substantial changes are made then they would manually remove the positive votes and ask for another round of review. FWIW, Google internally we always trust and even copy positive votes for all code changes. I would love to do that in Gerrit, as well, if we could restrict this rule to only apply for maintainers.
