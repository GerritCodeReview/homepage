      "message": "Yeah, sorry this came out of a mailing list discussion. The text in the boxes is fine, however the boxes have big \"Learn More\" buttons which lead to pages that don\u0027t really seem to describe what the box was about. Also, the workflow box has an icon of a lock, which I find strange and not indicative of a workflow at all. The icon for discuss and code review, while pretty, does not seem to be inline with any Gerrit graphics and does not feel representative to me of the project. \n\nSo the good stuff that seems salvageable to me would be the 3 statements, the git icon, and perhaps the entire download box?\n\nPerhaps as David suggested, this would be better on the about page? I\u0027m just not sure its worth a lot to try and make them fit just to salvage them though. I agree that having a nice about page would be good, I just don\u0027t think these boxes \"as is\" would really be very good. If we want to just shove them onto the about page for now and worry about them later, I\u0027ll gladly do that?",

      "message": "With all the other boxes gone the one Download box looks unnaturally big and upsets the overall balance of the landing page.\n\nCould we:\n1. Keep the boxes but remove the \"Learn more\" link. IMO the padlock symbol isn\u0027t that awful since the one of the main benefits of Gerrit is the ACL (perhaps more what it does than how you do it).\n2. Keep only the \"Download\" box but make it significantly smaller, and perhaps move it to the bottom.\n3. Remove the Download button as well, and perhaps adding download buttons to releases-readme instead (in a follow-up change.)\n\nWhere I\u0027m leaning towards option 1 or 3, in no particular order of preference.",
