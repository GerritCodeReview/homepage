      "message": "Personally, I am very skeptical that Google will finalize the switch to Java 11 internally by the Q2 2020, so that the switch would definitely miss gerrit release 3.2 and probably gerrit release 3.3 (Q4 2020) as well. That why this line is misplaced here and should be moved to the \"Distant future\" section below.\n\nSee for example this Liam Miller-Cushon\u0027s answer: [1] on Bazel\u0027s issue:\n\n  Header compilation doesn\u0027t work on Java 11 source code\n\nfrom September 2019 that Google has not \"started to use Java 11 internally yet; it needs to be fixed to support 11.\"\n\n* [1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8585#issuecomment-531442549",

      "message": "Google doesn\u0027t use the plain vanilla gerrit.war in their setup, so it won\u0027t matter if they moved to Java 11 or not.\n\nWe can move the war distribution and target Java 11, as long as the code can be also compiled with Java 8. We would introduce the double validation on the CI jobs.\n\n@Alice is that a correct statement?",

      "message": "This is a wrong statement: gerrit coden is already today Java 8 and Java 11 compatible.\n\nWe want to switch to use Java 11 features and be able to consume the transitive dependencies, that also switched to Java 11 language level. Jetty upcoming 10 release can only be used with Java 11. Also see Matthias comment why it would make sense to switch to java 11 for JGit in this change.",
