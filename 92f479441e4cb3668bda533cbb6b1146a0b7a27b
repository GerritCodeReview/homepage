That why this line is misplaced here and should be moved to the \"Distant future\" section below.\n\nSee for example this Liam Miller-Cushon\u0027s answer: [1] on Bazel\u0027s issue:\n\n  Header compilation doesn\u0027t work on Java 11 source code\n\nfrom September 2019 that Google has not \"started to use Java 11 internally yet; it needs to be fixed to support 11.\"\n\n* [1] https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8585#issuecomment-531442549",
