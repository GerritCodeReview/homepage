## Testimonials

The Gerrit community has a high interest in the users of the Gerrit Code Review
project. We want to understand who our users are, why they like Gerrit and how
Gerrit is integrated with their workflows. If your project or company is using
Gerrit, we would like to know about your use case, so that we are aware of it
when we evolve Gerrit further. If you use Gerrit, we kindly ask you to share
your usage as a testimonial below.

### How to add a testimonial?

Upload a change to the
[homepage](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/homepage) project
that adds your testimonial to this page. If you don't know how to do this, just
send an email to the
[repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!pendingmsg/repo-discuss)
mailing list that has a subject starting with '[testimonial]' and a Gerrit
maintainer will take care to upload the kudos for you.
