## Kudos

Gerrit is an open source project and its success much depends on the Gerrit
community and the people driving it. Every day we see highly engaged and
motivated contributors and kudos is a way for you to thank them and show your
appreciation.

Kudos is a public written thank you note of appreciation. These can be given by
anyone to any Gerrit contributor and are public on the Gerrit homepage.

Kudos can be given for doing a good job (e.g. fixing an important bug, helping
someone resolve an issue, speaking at an event etc.) or living good citizenship
behavior (e.g. doing lots of reviews, actively helping users on the mailing
list, caring about releases, organizing community events, maintaining plugins
etc.).

### How to add kudos?

Upload a change to the [homepage](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/homepage)
project that adds the kudos to this page. If you don't know how to do this, just
send an email to the [repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!pendingmsg/repo-discuss)
mailing list that has a subject starting with '[kudos]' and a Gerrit maintainer
will take care to upload the kudos for you.

  I want to thank Shawn for starting the Gerrit Code Review project and
  fostering a great open source community around it.

  Shawn's passion and dedication are the source of our success. Shawn was an
  outstanding engineer who shaped the long-term vision for our project. The
  number of his contributions is beyond count, his guidance and deep technical
  knowledge were exceptional and I'm truely thankful for all his reviews that
  made me learn so much.
