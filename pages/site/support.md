## Support

The Gerrit open source community actively supports the last 2 releases
on a best effort basis. Older releases are not actively maintained but
may still receive important fixes (e.g. security fixes), but there is
no guarantee for this. Which fixes are backported to these old
releases is decided on a case by case basis.

End of life for old releases happens implicitly when a new Gerrit version
is released, and is not necessarily announced.

## Questions

For questions write to the mailing list (<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/repo-discuss">repo-discuss on Google Groups</a>),
or check the questions tagged with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gerrit">[gerrit]</a>
on Stack Overflow.

The repo-discuss mailing list is managed to prevent spam posts. This
means posts from new participants must be approved manually before they
appear on the mailing list. Approvals normally happen within 1 work
day. Posts of people that participate in mailing list discussions
frequently are approved automatically.
