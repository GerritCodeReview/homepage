## Support

The Gerrit open source community actively supports the last 2 releases
on a best effort basis. Older releases are not actively maintained but
may still receive important fixes (e.g. security fixes), but there is
no guarantee for this. Which fixes are backported to these old
releases is decided on a case by case basis.

End of life for old releases happens implicitly when a new Gerrit version
is released, and is not necessarily announced.

The following table shows the current level of support for Gerrit releases:

| Version  | Support Status |
|----------|----------------|
| 3.0      | Active         |
| 2.16     | Active         |
| 2.15     | Active         |
| 2.14     | EOL [since 31 May 2019](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2019-05-31-gerrit-end-of-life-update.html) |
| 2.13     | EOL            |
| pre 2.13 | EOL            |
