encounter an issue with Gerrit.

Here you will reach a majority of Gerrit contributors and Gerrit
admins around the world. More often than not someone has had your
issue before and can help you.

environment and configuration by searching for or submitting your
questions to [Repo Discuss][repo-discuss] you leverage the collective
knowledge of the entire Gerrit community world wide.

## Bugs

If the issue/question you posted on Repo Discuss is considered a bug
the community will ask you to create an issue for tracking it.
Bugs are reported to the [issue tracker][issue-tracking].
The issue tracker is not a good place to initially request new
features as the main focus for those consuming it is fixing bugs.

## New Features

The Gerrit project has adopted a
[feature request model][feature-request] where you are asked to
submit your feature request together with some valid, general,
use-cases.
