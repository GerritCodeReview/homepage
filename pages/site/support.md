## General Support

[Repo Discuss][repo-discuss] should be your first stop when you
encounter an issue with Gerrit.

Here you will reach a majority of Gerrit contributors and Gerrit
admins around the world. Often someone has had your issue before
and can help you.

Many questions regarding Gerrit concerns are a direct result of
local environment and configuration. Often such issues have already
been discussed on the repo-discuss mailing list and you may find an
answer by searching through the existing posts. If you have a new
question, you can start a new discussion thread. Via the mailing
list you can reach a plethora of Gerrit experts in our world wide
community and benefit from their collective knowledge.

## Bugs

If the issue/question you posted on Repo Discuss is considered a bug
the community will ask you to create an issue for tracking it.
Bugs are reported to the [issue tracker][issue-tracking].
The issue tracker is not always the best place to initially request
new features, as the main focus for those consuming it is fixing
bugs.

[issue-tracking]: /issues.html

## New Features

The Gerrit project has adopted a
[feature request model][feature-request] where you are asked to
submit your feature request together with some valid, general,
use-cases.
