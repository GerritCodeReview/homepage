## Open Usage Commons

In July 2020, Google announced it would be moving the Gerrit trademark
to the [Open Usage Commons](https://openusage.org/). The Open Usage
Commons focuses on helping open source projects navigate trademarks,
and finding ways to apply the Open Source Definition to how open
source project trademarks are handled. The Open Usage Commons Board
will be working on developing open source project trademark usage
guidelines, and managing the trademarks of [Angular](https://angularjs.org/),
[Istio](https://istio.io/), and [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/).

If you are currently using the Gerrit trademark, you can continue to
do so, following any applicable, existing usage guidelines. In the
future, users will see usage guidelines that give them explicit
permission to use the Gerrit mark, and if you see a trademark issue,
you will want to contact the Open Usage Commons.
