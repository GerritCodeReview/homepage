## Contributing

### How can I contribute?

The [How To Contribute](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.13.1/dev-community.html#how-to-contribute)
section of the Gerrit documentation tells you all you need to know about
developer setup, CLAs, how to propose new features to the community etc.

### Where do I start?

If you want to contribute to the Gerrit community, but don't know were to start,
there is a set of well defined Bugs and Feature Requests of various sizes
in the [Help Wanted hotlist](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/hotlists/5395287)
in the issue-tracker.
Just pick any of these issues that seem interesting, assign it to yourself and
start.

If you want you can present yourself to the community and announce that you
have started working on the issue in any of the [community forums](contact.html).
This will provide some context for the community if (when) you have additional
questions or issues.
