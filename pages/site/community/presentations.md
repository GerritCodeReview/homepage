## Presentations

Community members willing to learn about Gerrit may find useful resources on this single page.
The listed presentations can be tutorials, slides, videos, channels or other relevant formats.

### How to add presentations

Upload a change to the [homepage](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/homepage)
project that adds the presentation to this page. If you don't know how to do this, just
send an email to the [repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/repo-discuss)
mailing list that has a subject starting with '[presentation]' and a Gerrit maintainer
will take care to upload the presentation for you.
