## Presentations

Community members willing to learn about Gerrit may find useful resources on this single page.
The listed presentations can be tutorials, slides, videos, channels or other relevant formats.
There are [tutorials also in the Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/index.html#_tutorials).

### How to add presentations

Upload a change to the [homepage](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/homepage)
project that adds the presentation to this page. If you don't know how to do this, just
send an email to the [repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/repo-discuss)
mailing list that has a subject starting with '[presentation]' and a Gerrit maintainer
will take care to upload the presentation for you.
