## Release Highlights

* New change workflows for changes not yet ready for full review (formerly
  Drafts).

* The new PolyGerrit UI is mature enough for most uses.

* Account data is stored in
  [NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/config-accounts.html).

* NoteDb for change metadata is considered stable, and new sites use it by
  default.

* NoteDb migration for change metadata is available.

* Made several improvements and additions to the documentation to help users
  find the information they need.

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```
### Support for draft changes removed

Support for draft changes and draft patch sets has been completely removed.

In most cases, the new Work-In-Progress workflow is a suitable replacement.
Note that in the Draft workflow, an individual patch set can be a Draft.
However, in both the new Work-In-Progress and Private workflows, WIP and Private
apply to the whole change, not an individual patch set.

When upgrading from an earlier version, draft changes are migrated.
This applies to all draft changes, or changes with draft patch sets
(even if the highest patch set is not a draft), as follows:

1. The "Draft" flag is removed from all patch sets.
1. If the change has been merged or abandoned, no further action is taken.
1. Otherwise, the change is moved to one of
    * Work-In-Progress change (this is the default)
    * Private change

The upgrade process prompts (once) for what Drafts should be migrated to;
either WIP (default) or Private.

The migration means that some draft patch sets, which were previously hidden,
might now be visible to some users who could not previously view them.

Change owners can make them private again using the "Mark Private" option
in the UI, or using the REST API.

### Votes no longer changed retroactively due to permissions

Historically, Gerrit would retroactively change votes on a label when
permissions for the voting user changed. For example, if a user voted
Code-Review+2, but then later lost permission to vote +2 (for example, was
removed from a Maintainers group), all CR+2 votes by that user on open changes
would suddenly appear as CR+1. In 2.15, this retroactive behavior no longer
applies: the CR+2 votes remain CR+2, even if permissions were changed.

This new behavior makes label permissions more consistent with other
permissions: usually, permission changes don't apply retroactively (you can't
un-submit a change), and the permission is only checked at the time an action is
performed. It also fixes some technical issues and improves performance of
reindexing changes.

### Release Signatures

Starting in the 2.14.x bugfix series, all release JARs and documentations are
signed by the [Gerrit
maintainers](public-keys.md). This
policy will continue for all future releases.

### New URL Scheme

By default, all Gerrit URLs generated and used by the UI include not just the
change number but the project name as well.

* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/1234` becomes
  `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/c/some/project/+/1234`
* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/#/c/1234` becomes
  `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/#/c/some/project/+/1234`
* `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/changes/1234` becomes
  `https://gerrit.mycompany.com/some%2Fproject~1234`

In addition to providing more context to humans reading the URL, this new
scheme improves performance under NoteDb, and paves the way for load balancing
a multi-master installation with repository affinity.

Old URLs will continue to be supported, and simply redirect to the new URLs.

### NoteDb for Accounts

Almost all account data is now stored in
[NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/config-accounts.html).
The account data is migrated automatically during the upgrade process by running
`gerrit.war init`.

The only account data not stored in NoteDb proper are the groups (remain in
ReviewDb) and the reviewed flags which were moved to an external database
(AccountPatchReviewDb) since [2.13](2.13.md).

For Gerrit slaves the
[branches that contain the account data](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/config-accounts.html#replication)
must be replicated.

### NoteDb for Changes

With this release, the new Gerrit storage backend,
[NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/note-db.html),
is officially supported for storing change metadata and is the default storage
backend for new installations.

For existing sites, migration to the new backend may be done either offline or
online in a running server.

Support for ReviewDb will be removed in Gerrit 3.0. Gerrit 3.0 will only
support offline migration; to run an online migration, you must use the 2.15.x
series.

### Daemon User Setup

The setup documentation now recommends setting up a user named `gerrit` instead
of `gerrit2`. This username can be anything; the choice of name doesn't affect
any functionality. However, some example commands in the documentation may
refer to the new `gerrit` user, so admins might need to tweak them to refer to
`gerrit2` instead.

### Strict validation on labels

In 2.15, posting a review including a vote on any labels that does not exist or is
outside of the permitted range based on the ACLs will now always result in a
failure of the entire operation. Previously, if the "strict labels" option was set
to disabled in the review input, votes to any invalid labels would be silently
ignored. This option has now been removed from the [REST API's ReviewInput](#rest-api)
as well as the [SSH review command](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/cmd-review.html).

CI systems that rely on the non-strict behaviour of earlier Gerrit versions may
require additional configuration to avoid casting votes to labels which are
invalid for the change.

Following [feedback on the 2.15 release](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/repo-discuss/nMZo3HMgJSY)
a new configuration option `change.strictLabels` was introduced in [2.15.2](#2152)
to allow the new strict functionality to be optionally enabled. By default it is
disabled to maintain backwards compatibility with previous release.

## New Features

### PolyGerrit UI

* Implement admin interface (projects, groups and plugins).

* Refreshed UI based on material design.

* Add hashtag support.

* Add support to show uploader on change screen.

* Lots of bug fixes.

### New Workflows

#### Draft, Private, Work-In-Progress

The draft change feature has been removed, and replaced with two separate
features:

* [Private
  changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#private-changes)
are visible only to the owner and reviewers.
* [Work-in-progress
  changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#wip)
do not generate notifications.

#### Ignore Changes, Mark Reviewed

Changes can be [ignored, or
marked as reviewed](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#ignore),
to reduce email notifications and keep dashboards cleaner.

#### Explicitly Record Reverted Changes

When a change is reverted via the "Revert" button, this fact is recorded in the
change metadata of the newly-created revert change, not just in the commit
message as in the past. A new search operator `revertof:` allows for searching
for reverts of a given change.

#### Delete Inline Comments

Individual inline comments can be deleted after the fact by site
administrators.

#### CCs Users By Email

Users may be CCed on changes by entering their email address, even if they have
not registered an account on the Gerrit server.

This feature is only available when using NoteDb.

#### Publish Comments on Push

When pushing new patch sets on a change or a series of changes, users can
configure Gerrit to automatically [publish any pending draft
comments](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/intro-user.html#publish-comments-on-push)
they have on those changes, avoiding the need to click through the web UI to
publish all comments.

#### Mark Changes Due to Rebase

When diffing two patch sets of the same change that have different parents,
some differences between the patch sets may be due to the rebase, instead of
changes between the patch set and its base. These differences are now
highlighted in the UI (PolyGerrit only), and are not counted towards the size
of diffs.

#### Improved Push Error Messages

When a push fails because the user does not have the required permission, the generic message
`(prohibited by Gerrit)` has been replaced with a detailed message describing
the exact permissions required.

### Documentation updates

With this release, we have updated several sections of the documentation to
make it easier for users to find the information they need. These updates
include:

* New [Quickstart guide](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/linux-quickstart.html)
  to install Gerrit on Linux
* New [About Gerrit](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/index.html#_about_gerrit)
  section that helps to introduce users to Gerrit
* New [Concepts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/index.html#_concepts)
  section to explain Gerrit-specific concepts.

We have also made changes to improve navigation throughout the
documentation.

### REST API

#### Projects

* [ProjectInfo](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-projects.html#project-info)
  now contains label configuration information.

#### Changes

* [Mark Private](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#mark-private)

* [Unmark Private](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#unmark-private)

* [Ignore](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#ignore)

* [Unignore](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#unignore)

* [Mark as Reviewed](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#mark-as-reviewed)

* [Mark as Unreviewed](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#mark-as-unreviewed)

* [ChangeInfo](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#change-info)
  now records the change that this change was a revert of.

* [Get Pure Revert](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#get-pure-revert)

* [Delete Comment](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#delete-comment)

* [Apply Fix](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#apply-fix)

* [ChangeInfo](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#change-info)
  now contains the submitter, for merged changes.

* [ReviewInput](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#review-input)
  no longer offers the `strict_labels` option. It will behave as enabled with
  earlier versions of Gerrit. The entire operation will now fail if any of the
  labels used are not within the user's permitted range based on ACLs or if the
  label is not configured for the project/branch.

#### Groups

* [GroupInfo](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-groups.html#group-info)
  now contains a `created_on` field.

#### Config

* [Check Consistency](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-config.html#check-consistency)

### API

* New Java API for accessing plugins.

* New Java API for accessing custom project dashboards.

* New `getGroups` method in account API to get a user's group memberships.

* New `ChangeReportFormatter` extension point for customizing the report output
  from `git push`.

* Instances of [IdString](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.15/gerrit-extension-api/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/restapi/IdString.java)
  used to return true when `equals` was given a String instance equal to the
  IdString's URL-encoded value. This violates
  [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Definition), so
  this behavior was removed: IdStrings now never compare equal to Strings.

### Replication plugin

* It is now possible to replicate directly to another Gerrit instance.

  Is is possible to enable replication to different Gerrit instance by using
  `gerrit+ssh://` as the protocol name followed by the hostname of another
  Gerrit server.

### Hooks plugin

* Username parameters are added to hook invocations.

  When an account parameter is passed to a hook, it gets formatted as
  `Name (Email)` or just `Name` when the account does not have an email
  address. If the account's name is not set, the name is "Anonymous
  Coward". From this information it is not easy for a hook to get the
  account's username.

  All hooks that take an account parameter now automatically also get a
  corresponding username parameter. For example if the hooks takes the
  parameter `--change-owner Name (Email)` it will automatically also get
  the parameter `--change-owner-username username`

### 2.15.3

* [Issue 8915](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8915):
Fix file handle leak when running GC.
  Upgrade JGit to 4.9.2.201712150930-r.15-g5fe8e31d4 which includes a
  [fix](https://git.eclipse.org/r/124285) to prevent the file handle
  leak.
* [Issue 8866](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8866):
Add project and account settings to create new changes as WIP by default.
* [Issue 6094](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6094)
and [Issue 9112](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9112):
Add support for Elasticsearch versions 5 and 6.
  Support is added for Elasticsearch versions 5.6 (tested with versions 5.6.9
  and 5.6.10), 6.2 (tested with version 6.2.4) and 6.3.1.
  Version 2.4 is still supported (tested with version 2.4.6).
  Instead of using the 'Jest' client to communicate with Elasticsearch, the
  Elasticsearch low level API is now used.
  Support for Elasticsearch is still considered experimental, and is not
  recommended for production use.
* [Issue 9372](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9372):
Simplify the configuration of Elasticsearch servers.
  Instead of specifying each server in a separate `[elasticsearch "name"]`
  section, with separate values `protocol`, `hostname`, and `port`, the
  servers are now configured as a list of `server` values in the
  `[elasticsearch]` section.
  This also fixes [Issue 9383](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9383)
  where a "default" server `http://localhost:9200` would be added by
  the site initialization even if other servers were already explicitly
  configured.
  During startup the list of configured Elasticsearch servers is logged
  at info level.
* [Issue 9146](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9146) and
[Issue 9147](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9147):
Fix Elasticsearch queries for results with substrings in keywords.
  Doing a query that involved the characters "." and "_" from full text fields
  did not include results with keywords as a substring. This behavior was
  different from Lucene, where these two characters are mapped to the space
  character (" ") so that the query returns keywords separated by them.
* Allow to omit the `elasticsearch.username` setting.
  If `elasticsearch.password` is specified, the `username` can be omitted and
  it will default to `elastic` which is the default username configured
  when running Elasticsearch with security enabled.
* Allow to assign "Delete Own Changes" permission to "Change Owners".
  It was only possible for a user to delete their own change if they were
  a member of a group that was assigned the "Delete Own Changes" permission.
  This was counter-intiuitive as it was necessary to either create a specific
  group, or assign the permission to "Registered Users".
  It is now possible to assign this permission to the "Change Owners"
  virtual group.
* [Issue 9354](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9354):
Add "Delete Changes" permission.
  It was only possible for a user to delete another user's change if they
  were a member of a group that was assigned the "Administrate Server"
  permission.
  A new "Delete Changes" permission is added. This permission can be
  assigned to a group, or to the "Project Owners" virtual group.
* [Issue 9345](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9345):
Fix creation of plugin log file when `log4j.configuration` is set
  When the environment variable `log4j.configuration` is set, log files
  defined by plugins were not created because the appender couldn't be
  found.
* Fix repeated `Change-Id` in error message when `Change-Id` line is not
in the footer.
* [Issue 9245](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9245):
Return the correct information in JSON response after moving a change.
  When moving a change by the REST API, the JSON response contained the
  branch name of the original destination rather than the new destination.
* Fix internal error when moving a change to a branch that does not have a label.
  If a change had a score on a label that was only configured on the
  original branch, moving to a destination branch that did not have the
  label caused an internal error.
* Fix internal error when moving a change without specifying the destination.
  Omitting the destination branch in the input caused an internal error.
* Fix internal error when deleting a comment without providing input.
  The input is optional on the [Delete Comment](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/rest-api-changes.html#delete-comment)
  REST endpoint, but calling it without input resulted in an internal error.
* Fix internal error when rebuilding Note DB and a change is missing from Review DB.
* Fix omission of 'branch' values when saving project config.
  The 'branch' values were omitted when saving the config, resulting in them
  being lost.
* [Issue 9195](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9195):
Strip comment lines out of commit message when creating change.
  When a change was created from the UI (or via the 'Create Change' REST
  API), and the commit message consisted of only a subject beginning with
  a hash character (`#`), the change was created with a zero Change-Id.
  This was because lines beginning with `#` are considered to be comments,
  and are stripped from the commit message by JGit before computing the
  Change-Id for the commit.
  Before attempting to create the change, Gerrit now strips out any comment
  lines from the commit message and returns an error if this results in
  the commit message being empty.
* [Issue 9389](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9389):
Fix support for syntax highlighting of Clojure source files in the Polygerrit UI.
* [Issue 5316](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=5316):
Fix incorrect relative URL paths in Gitiles links in the Polygerrit UI.
* Fix internal server error when generating email sender name for
non-existing account.
* Add `--generate-http-password` option to the ssh `set-account` command.
  To bring the ssh command more in-line with the REST API for a user, it
  is now possible to generate a new HTTP password.
  This allows ordinary users to generate a new HTTP password via ssh when
  they cannot log in to the web UI (e.g. due to being a service account).
  Access to the `set-account` command is also relaxed; normal users may
  use it to set a new password on their own account.
* Sanitize values of `user.name` and `user.email` from `gerrit.config`.
  The `user.name` and `user.email` settings were being read as-is, which
  would allow them to be configured with values that may interfere with
  standard email name/address parsing.
* Fix the default text in the 'Password' field on the 'HTTP Password' screen
in the GWT UI.
  The default text said "(click 'generate' to revoke an old password)" but the
  label of the button is actually "Generate Password".
* Add reporting of work queue related metrics.
  Metrics are reported for core work queues. For work queues created by plugins,
  metrics are not reported.

### 2.15.2

* [Issue 8861](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8861):
Fix generation of change numbers to prevent duplicates.
  When migration to NoteDb was aborted, and then started again later,
  generated change numbers overlapped with change numbers created in
  ReviewDb in the meantime.
* [Issue 8931](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8931):
Pass the project name to 'change indexed' event listeners.
  When NoteDb is enabled, the change information is stored in the project's
  git repository. Without the project name, plugins were not able to retrieve
  the change information.
* [Issue 8742](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8742):
Fix infinite loop in intraline diff loader.
  A regression introduced in 2.15.1 caused excessive CPU usage when loading
  intraline diffs.
* [Issue 8697](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8697):
Restore the ability to ignore invalid review labels.
  In 2.15 the `strict_labels` attribute was removed from the review input
  entity, and Gerrit no longer silently ignores invalid label scores. This
  caused breakage in CI systems that submit reviews post-merge and don't
  have different configurations for if the change is already merged or not.
  For example the Gerrit Trigger Plugin was broken, as
  [discussed on the Gerrit mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/repo-discuss/nMZo3HMgJSY).
  A new configuration [`change.strictLabels`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15.2/config-gerrit.html#change.strict_labels)
  is introduced. When enabled, Gerrit will reject invalid labels, otherwise
  will silently ignore them. By default it is disabled, for backwards
  compatibility with previous releases.
* [Issue 8728](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8728):
Allow percent encoding in patch set titles.
* [Issue 8850](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8850):
Fix `reviewerin:` search results when user is added as CC.
  The `reviewerin:` search should only return users that were added as a
  reviewer, but was also including users that were added as CC.
* [Issue 8817](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8817):
Fix internal server error when listing projects and a repository is not available.
  The new permission backend was throwing an error when a repository could
  not be found. Now it is simply omitted from the project list.
* [Issue 8643](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8643):
Properly display the status of "Work in Progress" changes.
  When a change was submittable (i.e. had all the necessary labels) but
  was still in the "Work in Progress" state, its status was displayed as
  "Merge Conflict" in the change list and the change screen in the GWT UI.
* [Issue 8936](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8936):
Add missing 'Hashtags' label on the change screen in the GWT UI.
* [Issue 8916](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8916):
Allow ownerin predicate to be evaluated by the index.
* Fix double creation of SSH command execution queues.
* Fix timestamp for submodule updates.
  When a submodule was updated by subscription, the same commit timestamp
  was always used due to the server identity being cached.
* Allow to include username in servlet response header.
  By setting `http.addUserAsResponseHeader`, the servlet response includes
  a 'User' header that contains the name of the logged in user, enabling
  reverse proxies to log the name of the user that issued the http request.
* Fix user permission checks in APIs when invoked via the GerritApi.
  Actions were incorrectly being denied because the user validation
  was comparing user object instances rather than the account ID that
  they represented.
* Allow to replace the default H2 persistent cache with a custom implementation.
  The default H2 persistent cache can be replaced by a module that implements
  the `CacheImpl` interface.
  An implementation is provided for postgresql.
* Various logging improvements.
* Hooks plugin
  * [Issue 9015](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9015):
  Add a `submit` hook
    The `submit` hook is invoked synchronously when a change is submitted. If
    it returns a non-zero exit status, a `MergeValidationException` is thrown
    and the submit is prevented.
    This adds back the ability to block submit by a hook which was removed in
    version 2.14 due to the reworking of the `ref-update` hook behavior.
  * Fix repeated instantiation of the `ref-update` and `commit-received` hooks.
    The hooks were not singletons, which caused new instances to be created
    on every invocation.
  * Wrap account ID in quotes when passing as hook argument.
  * Improve logging to make it easier to track down hook execution problems.
    When a hook exits with an error status (i.e. non-zero), or times out, an error
    is now emitted to the log. Previously there was no log on timeout, and the exit
    status was only logged at debug level.
    The configured hooks path and resolved path for hook files is logged at info
    level.
    When a hook file does not exist, a message is logged at debug level.
  * Improve documentation
    * Expand and improve documentation related to debugging hooks.
    * Restructure the hooks page to separate synchronous and asynchronous hooks, and
    add a table of contents.
* Polygerrit fixes:
  * [Issue 8655](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8655):
  Clear suggestions on autocomplete input change.
  * [Issue 8237](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8237):
  Link account chips to owner search rather than user dashboard.
  * [Issue 8375](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8375):
  Add reset button to my menu in settings.

  removed.
* Fix removal of email/password on external ID update.
* Replication plugin:
    * Fix creation of missing repository.
      When replicating to a destination where the repository does not exist,

      not absolute.
