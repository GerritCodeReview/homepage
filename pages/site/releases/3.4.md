## Release highlights

## Important notes

### JCraft JSch client library is disabled per default

Deprecated JCraft JSch client library is replaced with MINA SSHD client library
per default. There is still option to switch to using JCraft JSch client library.
Support for JCraft JSch will be removed in the next gerrit release.

### Default support for Java 11

The java language level is now set to Java 11 by default for Gerrit.

* [Issue 13494](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13494);
  Generate a Java 11 Eclipse project by default

* Update dev-{eclipse,intellij} development for Java 11.

Gerrit source code is still compatible with Java 8.

### Schema changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes.

The changes index version has been increased to version 61, new change search
operators were added: `mergedafter` and `mergedbefore`.

To run off-line reindexing of the changes (optional):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

By default the changes index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup
after the upgrade.

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.3 when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
when the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

For upgrading with zero-downtime, you should enable the rolling upgrade migration
in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers by setting the
[`gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.3/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade)
to `true`.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit operation
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers upgraded to v3.3 in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.
3. Set the first Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the first Gerrit server, upgrade to v3.4 and start Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the first Gerrit server is working properly and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the first Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for the second Gerrit server.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.3.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.4.x server
2. Run Gerrit v3.3.x init
3. Startup Gerrit v3.3.x server

### Breaking changes

#### `is:mergeable` predicate is disabled per default.

Computing `is:mergeable` has a O(N^2) runtime computation complexity depending
on the number of open changes on a branch and on the size of the changes.
Hence skip this computation per default to avoid the associated runtime effort.

Most Gerrit installation already disabled this feature and thus wouldn't need
to change anything. Otherwise, to restore the previous behaviour this option:
[`change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.0/config-gerrit.html#change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior)
should be changed to `API_REF_UPDATED_AND_CHANGE_REINDEX`.

#### HTML plugin support is removed

HTML plugins should be migrated to JavaScript plugins.
This also implies Polymer 2 plugins wouldn't work any more. See also this announcement
for more [details](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss/c/YJY8oQZZo44/m/wt-OAosQBAAJ).

These unused JavaScript Plugin API methods were removed:

* `plugin.annotationApi().setLayer()`, `plugin.annotationApi().enableToggleCheckbox()`
* `plugin.changeMetadata().*`
* `plugin.changeReply().send()`
* `plugin.eventHelper().on()`, `plugin.eventHelper().captureClick()`,
  `plugin.eventHelper().captureTap()`
* `plugin.project().*`
* `plugin.settings().*`
* `plugin.styles().*`
* `plugin.theme().*`
* `plugin.get()`, `plugin.post()`, `plugin.put()`, `plugin.delete()`: Replaced by their counterparts in
  `plugin.restApi()`.

#### ChangeAttributeFactory is removed

As noted in the [v3.3 release notes](/3.3.html#changeattributefactory-deprecated-and-changeplugindefinedinfofactory-supported),
ChangeAttributeFactory has been removed.

## Native packaging

## New features

### Checks UI

Gerrit now has a native UI for displaying run/result info from builds, tests, analyzers, etc.
The data for this new Checks UI must be provided by JavaScript plugins using the
[Checks API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.0/pg-plugin-checks-api.html).
Checks information will be summarized by chips below the commit message. Detailed information
is shown on a dedicated `Checks` tab next to the `Files` and `Comments` tabs.

### Unresolved Comments ported to latest patchset

Unresolved comments that were left on older patchsets will now also be shown on newer patchsets.
The backend provides two new endpoints `ported_comments/` and `ported_drafts/` for the UI to
retrieve the data and for showing the comments in the correct position.

### Comment Chips and Context

Comment state (resolved, unresolved, draft) is summarized by chips below the commit message. The
Comments Tab and the Change Log will not just show the comment thread, but also the snippet of
code (where the comment was made) as context.

## Bugfix releases

### 3.4.8

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 16404](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16404):
  Fix disabled caches when reading all keys at once

    When disabling some caches like `git_file_diff` the fetching of the keys
    was causing a ClassCastException and the associated Gerrit functionality
    was broken. This change fixes the bulk loading of all keys and allows
    to disable any of the Gerrit caches without regressions.

### 3.4.7 - Not recommended

* Known issues

  * [Issue 16404](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16404):
  Fix disabled caches when reading all keys at once

* New features

  * [Issue 16322](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16322):
  Limit the number of changes that can be submitted together

    When chaining changes together, the sequence of commits to navigate
    was previously unbound, causing the potential operations explosion.
    The explosion could have also been accidental and caused by the push
    of a change with a non-existent branch, which would have resulted
    in the full scan of the repository for changes.
    Introduce a new Gerrit configuration `change.maxSubmittableAtOnce` with
    a safe default of `32767`, which would allow any use case that would have
    also worked before this change.

  * [Change 347496](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347496):
  Enable project_list cache warmer when `cache.project_list.maxAge` is set

  * [Change 341454](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/341454):
  GitwebServlet: Retrieve git path from FileRepository so that it can be used
  with multi-site and cached-refdb modules

* Performance Fixes

  * [Issue 16379](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16379):
  Remove key locking for disabled caches

    This change also makes the memoryLimit behaviour consistent with the
    diskLimit set to zero means disabling the implementation of the cache.

  * [Change 349895](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349895):
  Add AndCardinalPredicate and OrCardinalPredicate

    Before this change, IndexSource derived cardinality from predicate
    which implement `HasCardinality`. Since `AndPredicate` and `OrPredicate`
    does not return cardinality, IndexSource defaults to 10 when query
    comprises more than one predicate. Due to this behavior, `AndSource`
    chooses IndexSource almost always when query contains more than one
    index predicate.
    This helps `AndSource` to choose the right source more often.

  * [Change 347956](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347956):
  Introduce possibility to define the cardinality so that `AndSource` predicate
  can work more efficiently

    Before this change, cardinality of the IndexSource was always set to
    10. This makes `AndSource` to choose IndexSource over other sources most of
    the time.
    Add a `HasCardinality` interface which can be used by all the predicates
    which implement IndexPredicate to set a cardinality. This helps
    AndSource to choose the right datasource.

  * [Change 349355](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349355):
  Cache repository locations in LocalDiskRepositoryManager

    Obtaining the actual location of a repository using base-path
    and project name can be slow as it involves some guessing to
    locate the repository. Cache the locations once they are
    obtained to avoid repeated work, thereby improving performance
    when opening repositories.

  * [Change 347955](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347955):
  Consider cardinality while choosing the data source for `AndSource` predicate

    Before this change, `AndSource` considered cost to choose a datasource.
    Ideally cost should be used to determine which predicate to run
    `#match()` against first, so that queries are faster. Cardinality should
    be used to determine which datasource to be picked so that there are
    fewer changes to process.
    Consider cardinality of the datasource to choose the source and use
    cost when cardinality is same.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Change 350014](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/350014):
  Do not set cherryPickOf on RevertSubmission

    The RevertSubmission internally uses CherryPickChange operation.  It
    creates the 'normal' revert for the first change in the relation chain,
    for each subsequent change it creates a revert commit that is then
    cherry-picked. This cherry-pick is not a cherry-pick of the reverted
    change. This is a cherry-pick of the revert commit of the original
    change.
    This change fixes the bug in the logic that sets cherryPickOf to the
    original (reverted) change, using the CherryPickChange operation.

  * [Change 349894](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349894):
  Don't always rewrite And/OrPredicate to And/OrSource

    Before this change OrPredicate was always rewritten to OrSource. This
    is not the right thing to do as `OrSource#read()` will eventually fail
    when there is at least one non-datasource child. Since
    [Change 347955](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347955),
    `AndSource` picks a source which has the lowest cardinality
    which makes the `OrSource#read()` failures more visible.
    Rewrite `OrPredicate` to `OrSource` only when all the children in the
    predicate are DataSources.

  * [Change 348715](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/348715);
  Clarify that a restart is needed before changes to email templates take
  effect

  * [Issue 16182](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16182):
  Reintroduce the Change-Id footer in change screen

    This change reintroduce the Change-Id footer below the commit message on
    the Gerrit UI.

  * [Issue 10168](https://crbug.com/gerrit/10168):
  Fix HTTP 404 when browsing tags on Gitweb

    The Gitweb links to tags have been broken in v2.14.10 onwards.
    Gitweb supports the 'a=tags' rendering action for annotated tags
    only, returning 404 for all lightweight tags.
    Use the generic 'a=shortlog' for Gitweb links to tags which would
    work for both annotated and lightweight ones.

  * [Change 347495](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347495):
  Fix for IllegalStateException during the Gerrit start when
  `cache.projects.refreshAfterWrite` is set to true and prolog rules are used

  * [Issue 15997](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15997):
  Make DelegateRepository#delegate() method public to allow plugins/modules to
  access it

### 3.4.6

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 16054](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16054):
  Fix confidentiality leak by users with create ref permission
  using the create branch REST-API

    Any user with create ref permission was able to gain
    access to any SHA1 or refs, including the ones that they would
    not have permission to see.

* Breaking changes

  * [Issue 15941](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15941):
  Fix SSH queries to not show commit-message unless --commit-message is provided

    This issue has existed for several years and should be considered
    breaking as users might expect commit message to be included by
    default in SSH query results.
    Obtaining the commit message is a costly operation as the commit
    data has to be loaded. So, showing it even when --commit-message
    is not provided degrades the performance of SSH queries.

  * [Change 344300](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/344300):
  Add missing return values in MetricMaker's `newCallbackMetric` and
  `newConstantMetric`

    When new callback and constant metrics were created the RegistrationHandle
    was not returned, making impossible to de-register them.
    The method signature is now aligned, however, all plugins, including the core ones,
    that were registering callback or constant metrics would need to be rebuilt from
    source or downloaded from the latest build on
    [Gerrit-CI](https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com).

* New features

  Elasticsearch

  * [Change 345017](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/345017):
  Add public `EventTypes.getRegisteredEvents()` for accessing all stream
  event types from plugins

  * [Change 340714](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/340714):
  Introduce metrics configuration for different data reservoirs

* Performance Fixes

  * [Change 338834](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338834):
  Avoid creating an IdentifiedUser multiple times in a SSH query
    This improves performance of SSH queries.

  * [Change 338574](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338574):
  Cache ProjectControl instances in SSH queries
    A PerThreadCache is used to cache ProjectControl instances to
    improve SSH query performance.

  * [Change 338474](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338474):
  Allow async receive-commits to have a thread-local cache
    Improve caching when merging changes through git push

  * [Change 338154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338154):

  * [Change 347474](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/347474):
  Fix DefaultMemoryCacheFactory to correctly set refreshAfterWrite
    Setting refreshAfterWrite in gerrit.config now works and does not mistakenly
    set expireAfterAccess

  * [Issue 15997](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15997):
  Make delegate() method public
    git-repo-metrics plugin now works with multi-site setup

  * [Issue 16038](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16038):
  Fix "internal error" when pushing to refs/users/xx/xxxx
    Push over HTTP to refs/users/* branch now works and doesn't fail with "error: internal error" / Not Signed In

  * [Issue 16001](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16001):
  AsciiDoctor: skip attribute when looking for title
    Fix documentation search showing :linkattrs: instead of the document title

  * [Issue 15134](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15134):
  Apply the match operator to filter projects
    Next-arrow is now not hidden when searching for repositories in the Repository section

  * [Change 337474](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337474):
  Use sane value for QueryProcessor's effective limit on "--no-limit"
    Fix errors seen when --no-limit query option is used with ES index backend

  * [Change 339754](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/339754):
  Fix gerrit review command with branch option

    The gerrit review command was not able to find the commit with branch
    option; ensure "refs/heads/" prefix is present for branch option.

  Fix change queries evaluation of `AND` terms  to run match on predicate whose cost is
  least

    Sort the change queries predicates in `AND` based on cost and cardinality, which
    was broken since [Change 79391]().

    **WARNING**: queries containing predicates with poorly defined costs or cardinalities
    could perform worse now.

* Dependency Updates

* Breaking changes

  * [Change 323855](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/323855) [Change 324115](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/324115):
  ProjectCache#evict no longer triggers a reindex.

    During offline project reindexing evict() was triggering a duplicate reindex
    on the project when we only wanted to evict the project cache entry. This same
    issue occurred with the HA plugin and could be/been present in other plugins.

    If you have relied on a reindex being done on evict() you need to use
    evictAndReindex() instead. This behavior is now consistent with other evict()
    methods in Gerrit.

* New features

  * [Change 324095](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/324095):

  * [Issue 14732](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14732):
  Commits/IncludedIn exposes branch names without respecting the ACLs on branches

     When calling the REST endpoint for listing all branches that a commit SHA1
     is part of, the commit is properly checked for visibility against the ACLs
     (it is a REST resource) but the branches are not checked.

     The included-in may expose the list of non-visible branches to a user that
     has visibility of the SHA1.

  * [Issue 7282](https://crbug.com/gerrit/7282):
  Hide repository name and description when user has no access
