## Release Highlights

## Important Notes

### Mergeability behavior and performance

This release introduces a configuration that defines when Gerrit computes the
mergability of a change ('change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior').

Computing the mergability of changes is an expensive operation that can be
become a bottleneck for large Gerrit installations. The new setting allows
administrators to control this expense. The tree options relate to the following
use-cases:

1. API_REF_UPDATED_AND_CHANGE_REINDEX: Mergeability is computed when Gerrit
   returns results on the API, reindexes changes and updates target refs.
2. REF_UPDATED_AND_CHANGE_REINDEX: Mergeability is computed when Gerrit
   reindexes changes and updates target refs.
3. NEVER: Optimize gerrit performance by shutting down mergeability computation
   entirely.

The documentation contains more information about this setting.
