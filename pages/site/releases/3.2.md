## Important Notes

### Support for Java 11

Gerrit is now officially supported on Java 11, in addition to Java 8.
Running on Java 11 was already possible from v2.16.13, v3.0.4 and v3.1.0, but not officially
supported because of the lack of a CI validation on Java 11 for stable-2.16, stable-3.0
and stable-3.1 branches.

Please note that Java 11 has a number of improvements and breaking changes compared to Java 8.
Refer to the [Java 11 release notes for more details](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/11-relnote-issues-5012449.html).

Gerrit v3.2 has been validated with Java 11, with the following known issues:

* [Issue 11567](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11567):
Java 11 runtime & startTLS LDAP broken: 'error code 8 - BindSimple: Transport encryption'.

* [Issue 12639](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12639):
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred, when starting Gerrit.

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

The changes index version has been increased. To run off-line reindexing of
the changes (optional):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index-name changes -d site_path
```

By default the changes index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup
after the upgrade.

**PERFORMANCE WARNING**: The migration process performs the cleanup of
the zombie draft comments in the All-Users.git repository that have been
left behind since the introduction of NoteDb. It is highly recommended
to perform a `git gc --aggressive` of the All-Users.git repository *BEFORE*
running the migration. Also the reindex of all the changes can take a
significant amount of time for large-scale installations.

Also, make sure that the All-Users.git resides on
a fast access local filesystem for minimizing the migration time.

## Native packaging

* Upgrade the Docker/Ubuntu image to Ubuntu 20.04

* Upgrade the Docker/CentOS image to CentOS 8.1.1911

* Move to OpenJDK 11

  Gerrit v3.2 supports both Java 8 and 11. However, Java 11 is the best choice for
  large production servers thanks to the introduction of more advanced Garbage Collection
  [strategies and associated tuning for large heaps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.html).

### Zero-downtime Upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.1.6 (or later) when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
when the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

For upgrading with zero-downtime, you should enable the rolling upgrade migration
in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters by setting the
[`gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html)
to `true`.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform the normal Gerrit operations
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit masters upgraded to v3.1.6 (or later) in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.
3. Set the first Gerrit master unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the first Gerrit master and then upgrade to v3.2.
5. Startup the first Gerrit master and wait for the on-line reindex to complete.
6. Verify that the first Gerrit master is working properly and then make it healthy again.
7. Wait for the first Gerrit master to start serving traffic normally.
8. Repeat steps 3. to 7. for the second Gerrit master.
9. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.

**NOTE**: During the zero-downtime upgrade, the nodes may experience an increase of CPU and memory
utilisation due to the online reindexing activity. If testing reveals that the nodes
are not able to keep sustained load in conjunction with the online reindexing, then you have
to follow the standard migration path.

### Breaking Changes

* [Issue 12527](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12527):
Elasticsearch: Support for EOL versions v5.6 and v6.0 to v6.5 is discontinued

* [Issue 12858](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12858):
ListGroups: the --query2 option in the groups query REST-API has been renamed to
--query

* Gerrit metrics associated with H2 disk-statistics are now disabled by default.
The disk-statistics can be enabled again by setting
[`cache.enableDiskStatMetrics`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#cache.enableDiskStatMetrics)
in gerrit.config.

* The number of comments per change are limited to 5000, and their size to 16k.
The limits can be customized in `gerrit.config` using the
[change.maxComments](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.maxComments) and
[change.commentSizeLimit](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.commentSizeLimit) settings.

## New Features

### Mergeability behavior and performance

This release introduces a configuration setting `change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior`
that defines when Gerrit computes the mergability of a change .

Computing the mergability of changes is an expensive operation that can be
become a bottleneck for large Gerrit installations. The new setting allows
administrators to control this expense. Please refer to the
[Gerrit documentation](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior)
for more details about this setting.

The setting
[`change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.1.5/config-gerrit.html#change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo)
is no longer used and may be removed from `gerrit.config`.

### New accounts cache

Introduction of a brand-new AccountCache decomposed into smaller chunks that can be
cached individually:

- External IDs + user name (cached in ExternalIdCache)
- CachedAccountDetails (newly cached)
- Gerrit’s default settings CachedAccountDetails – a new class representing all
  information stored under the user’s ref (`refs/users/<sharded-id>`)

The new structure is cleverly designed to require a lot less I/O when an entry needs to be
reloaded and lowering the ratio of cache-miss in case of user’s details updates.

### New external groups cache

Gerrit can be linked to external user directories like LDAP, providing Gerrit with
external users and groups. External groups can be added to Gerrit to restrict access
to refs and repos and are mainly used for permissions evaluation.

The following new additional caches have been introduced and can be customized in
`gerrit.config`:

- `groups_external`: Caches all the external groups available to Gerrit.
- `groups_external_persisted`: Caches all external groups available to Gerrit at
  some point in history.

### File Uploads

File Uploads are now supported in the User Interface or through the REST API.

### New Revert permission

Introduce a new permission to allow/deny the ability to revert a change through
the Gerrit UI.

The permission is automatically added to the `Registered Users` as part of the
schema upgrade. To deny reverts, Gerrit administrators should remove this permission
from `All-Projects` ACL.

### New is:merge merge operator for searching changes

Introduce the new `is:merge` operator for allowing to find changes that are
merge commits. This change requires a full reindex of the changes, which may take
quite a long time to compute for large-sized installations.

When choosing the on-line reindexing option (default) Gerrit can still operate
with the old index version, disabling the `is:merge` operator until the new index
has been successfully rebuilt.

### New SSH commands

New SSH commands introduced:

- `gerrit set-topic`: set the topic of a change (existing REST-API surfaced via SSH)
- `gerrit sequence show`: show the current sequences value from All-Projects.git or All-Users.git
- `gerrit sequence set`: set the next value for sequences in All-Projects.git or All-Users.git

### Review labels stickiness

- [Issue 12025](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12025)
Allow to configure individual votes as sticky by setting the
[`label.Label-Name.copyValue`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-labels#label_copyValue) on the `project.config` labels.

### New CherryPickOf field for a change

After a change is created or updated using the 'cherry-pick' functionality,
the cherry-picked change includes a new field in the change info returned from REST APIs
called `CherryPickOf` with the source change number and the patchset.

### Other performance optimizations

- Ability to configure the number of relevant changes to consider when suggesting
the reviewers on the changes screen, using the `gerrit.config` setting
[`suggest.relevantChanges`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#suggest.relevantChanges)

### PolyGerrit UI

The Gerrit frontend has been migrated from Polymer 2 to
[Polymer 3](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/upgrade).

* Users can now cherry pick entire topics.

* Gerrit supports adding display names. Hosts can configure first name or username as default.

* The reply dialog now shows the entire comment thread instead of the comment list.

* [Issue 6293](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6293):
More self-evident transitions from WIP state. "Start Review" button added to change view.

* [Issue 8153](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8153):
Improvements to rebase indicator: display a hover card instead of a tooltip with the icon
including the possible rebase action.

* [Issue 10444](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10444):
UI for deleting change messages for Gerrit Administrators.

* [Issue 10890](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10890):
Repository list: Move "Repository Browser" column left of "Description" column.

* [Issue 11441](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11441):
Add in-product reminder to keep discussions respectful.

  Some code review discussions can become a bit rough and some people perceived
  discussions as not always respectful.
  Add an in-product reminder to keep discussions respectful when a reply is typed,
  optionally with linking to the code of conduct.

* [Issue 11493](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11493):
Add an "Edit" button to the diff view in the PolyGerrit UI.

* [Issue 11521](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11521):
Display trace ID in error popup if request failed and server did a trace.

* [Issue 11522](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11522):
REST API for review labels in the project configuration.

* [Issue 11705](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11705):
Show count of changes in User Dashboard.

* [Issue 11706](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11706):
Allow editing the commit message as part of a change edit.

* [Issue 11973](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11973):
Add copy-to-clipboard for generated HTTP password.

* [Issue 12364](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12364):
Add support for going to a specific line number in the inline editor.

### Download commands plugin

* [Issue 11594](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11594)
Merge the repo-vs-git logic into GitDownloadCommand directly.

   Created separate "getRepoCommand" and "getCommand" methods for
   downstream classes to extend with the default "getRepoCommand"
   defaulting to null.

* [Issue 11609](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11609)
"Download patch" UI includes an option for also creating a local branch.

  A very standard workflow is to download a change from Gerrit then want
  to make edits and then repo upload the changes back to Gerrit.
  Allow developers who are not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of repo,
  to easily create a local branch when checking out changes.

### End-to-end tests

* Allow end-to-end tests to proportionally scale on their expected execution times.

  A `power_factor` [environment property](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html#_environment_properties)
  was added to the end-to-end tests core framework. Using that optional property,
  scenario steps can take some more (or less) time prior to expecting proper completion.

  The way to set that property locally then depends on the target runtime environment,
  or SUT latency. The property may be used for either core or plugin scenarios.

* `FlushProjectsCache` related scenarios added to core (and the `high-availability` plugin).

* Support for relative runtime weights in scenarios.

  Each scenario can now either weight like any other by default, or override that default
  with a greater weight value, compared to siblings that are lighter on execution times.

  Beside core, make the `high-availability` and `multi-site` plugin scenarios reuse this.

* Allow scenarios to create and delete Gerrit changes alongside projects.

  Add the corresponding core support for an optional `http` request body to every such
  `GerritSimulation`. Either automate or allow [environment properties](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html#_environment_properties)
  to feed the related input test data.

  Beside core, make the `high-availability` and `multi-site` plugin scenarios test changes
  that way. The latter currently has [Issue 12693](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12693)
  as a known limitation.

### REST APIs

* Accounts

  * `display_name` field added to all the endpoints returning the account details.

  * [New Set Display Name](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#set-display-name) API for updating the account display name.

  * New [Modify Account](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
    global capability is now required for
    [List Accounts Emails](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#list-account-emails),
    [Get Account External IDs](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#get-account-external-ids) and
    [Delete Account External IDs](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids)
    when used to access information that belongs to accounts other than the caller.

* Changes

  * [Query Changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#list-changes)
  API now supports a new `no-limit` parameter for remove the default limit on queries and return
  all results. This might not be supported by all index backends.
  Also, the `SKIP_MERGEABLE` option for skipping the mergeability flag option is not supported anymore.

  * [Revert Change](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#revert-change)
  now truncates the revert message if exceeds 63 characters, by cutting it down to 59 characters
  with the ellipsis (`…​`) in the end.
  Also, the API requires now the new revert permission, otherwise a `403 Forbidden` status code is returned.

  * [Revert Submission](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#revert-submission)
  API for creating a submission-id for grouping multiple changes that belongs to the same submission
  (e.g. topic submission).

  * [Change file content in Change Edit](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#put-edit-file)
  API supports now uploading binary content.

  * New [Preview Fix](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#preview-fix)
  API for gettings the diffs of all files for a certain fix-id. This is intended to be used in conjunction
  with robot commits.

  * New `allow_conflicts` option in all API that perform a server-side merge or cherry-pick.

* Groups

  * [Query Groups](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-groups.html#query-groups)
  API accepts the `query` as parameter for groups filtering, instead of the `query2` which was
  a temporary name given to avoid clashes with an earlier deprecated parameter.

* Projects

  * Brand-new set of [Label Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-projects.html#label-endpoints)
  API for managing the project review labels in a programmatic way, without having to modify
  directly the `project.config` in the `refs/meta/config` of the repository.
