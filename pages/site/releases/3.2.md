## Release Highlights

* Polymer 3

* File Uploads in frontend

* Performance improvements on mergeability check and accounts caching

* Support for Java 11

## Important Notes

### Support for Java 11

Gerrit is now officially supported on Java 11, in addition to Java 8.
Running on Java 11 was already possible from v2.16.13, v3.0.4 and v3.1.0, but not officially
supported because of the lack of a CI validation on Java 11 for stable-2.16, stable-3.0
and stable-3.1 branches.

Please note that Java 11 has a number of improvements and breaking changes compared to Java 8.
Refer to the [Java 11 release notes for more details](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/11-relnote-issues-5012449.html).

Gerrit v3.2 has been validated with Java 11, with the following known issues:

* [Issue 11567](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11567):
Java 11 runtime & startTLS LDAP broken: 'error code 8 - BindSimple: Transport encryption'.

* [Issue 12639](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12639):
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred, when starting Gerrit.

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

The changes index version has been increased. To run off-line reindexing of
the changes (optional):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

By default the changes index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup
after the upgrade.

**PERFORMANCE WARNING**: The migration process performs the cleanup of
the zombie draft comments in the All-Users.git repository that have been
left behind since the introduction of NoteDb. It is highly recommended
to perform a `git gc --aggressive` of the All-Users.git repository *BEFORE*
running the migration. Also the reindex of all the changes can take a
significant amount of time for large-scale installations.

Also, make sure that the All-Users.git resides on
a fast access local filesystem for minimizing the migration time.

## Native packaging

* Upgrade the Docker/Ubuntu image to Ubuntu 20.04

* Upgrade the Docker/CentOS image to CentOS 8.1.1911

* Move to OpenJDK 11

  Gerrit v3.2 supports both Java 8 and 11. However, Java 11 is the best choice for
  large production servers thanks to the introduction of more advanced Garbage Collection
  [strategies and associated tuning for large heaps](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.html).

### Zero-downtime Upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.1.6 (or later) when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
when the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

For upgrading with zero-downtime, you should enable the rolling upgrade migration
in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters by setting the
[`gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html)
to `true`.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform the normal Gerrit operations
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit masters upgraded to v3.1.6 (or later) in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.
3. Set the first Gerrit master unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the first Gerrit master and then upgrade to v3.2.
5. Startup the first Gerrit master and wait for the on-line reindex to complete.
6. Verify that the first Gerrit master is working properly and then make it healthy again.
7. Wait for the first Gerrit master to start serving traffic normally.
8. Repeat steps 3. to 7. for the second Gerrit master.
9. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.

**NOTE**: During the zero-downtime upgrade, the nodes may experience an increase of CPU and memory
utilisation due to the online reindexing activity. If testing reveals that the nodes
are not able to keep sustained load in conjunction with the online reindexing, then you have
to follow the standard migration path.

### Breaking Changes

* [Issue 12527](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12527):
Elasticsearch: Support for [EOL versions](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
v5.6 and v6.0 to v6.5 is discontinued

* [Issue 12858](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12858):
ListGroups: the --query2 option in the groups query REST-API has been renamed to
--query

* Gerrit metrics associated with H2 disk-statistics are now disabled by default.
The disk-statistics can be enabled again by setting
[`cache.enableDiskStatMetrics`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#cache.enableDiskStatMetrics)
in gerrit.config.

* The number of comments per change are limited to 5000, and their size to 16k.
The limits can be customized in `gerrit.config` using the
[change.maxComments](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.maxComments) and
[change.commentSizeLimit](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.commentSizeLimit) settings.

## New Features

### Mergeability behavior and performance

This release introduces a configuration setting `change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior`
that defines when Gerrit computes the mergability of a change .

Computing the mergability of changes is an expensive operation that can be
become a bottleneck for large Gerrit installations. The new setting allows
administrators to control this expense. Please refer to the
[Gerrit documentation](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#change.mergeabilityComputationBehavior)
for more details about this setting.

The setting
[`change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.1.5/config-gerrit.html#change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo)
is no longer used and may be removed from `gerrit.config`.

### New accounts cache

Introduction of a brand-new AccountCache decomposed into smaller chunks that can be
cached individually:

- External IDs + user name (cached in ExternalIdCache)
- CachedAccountDetails (newly cached)
- Gerrit’s default settings CachedAccountDetails – a new class representing all
  information stored under the user’s ref (`refs/users/<sharded-id>`)

The new structure is cleverly designed to require a lot less I/O when an entry needs to be
reloaded and lowering the ratio of cache-miss in case of user’s details updates.

### New external groups cache

Gerrit can be linked to external user directories like LDAP, providing Gerrit with
external users and groups. External groups can be added to Gerrit to restrict access
to refs and repos and are mainly used for permissions evaluation.

The following new additional caches have been introduced and can be customized in
`gerrit.config`:

- `groups_external`: Caches all the external groups available to Gerrit.
- `groups_external_persisted`: Caches all external groups available to Gerrit at
  some point in history.

### File Uploads

File Uploads are now supported in the User Interface or through the REST API.

### New Revert permission

Introduce a new permission to allow/deny the ability to revert a change through
the Gerrit UI.

The permission is automatically added to the `Registered Users` as part of the
schema upgrade. To deny reverts, Gerrit administrators should remove this permission
from `All-Projects` ACL.

### New is:merge merge operator for searching changes

Introduce the new `is:merge` operator for allowing to find changes that are
merge commits. This change requires a full reindex of the changes, which may take
quite a long time to compute for large-sized installations.

When choosing the on-line reindexing option (default) Gerrit can still operate
with the old index version, disabling the `is:merge` operator until the new index
has been successfully rebuilt.

### New SSH commands

New SSH commands introduced:

- `gerrit set-topic`: set the topic of a change (existing REST-API surfaced via SSH)
- `gerrit sequence show`: show the current sequences value from All-Projects.git or All-Users.git
- `gerrit sequence set`: set the next value for sequences in All-Projects.git or All-Users.git

### Review labels stickiness

- [Issue 12025](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12025)
Allow to configure individual votes as sticky by setting the
[`label.Label-Name.copyValue`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-labels#label_copyValue) on the `project.config` labels.

### New CherryPickOf field for a change

After a change is created or updated using the 'cherry-pick' functionality,
the cherry-picked change includes a new field in the change info returned from REST APIs
called `CherryPickOf` with the source change number and the patchset.

### New Gerrit configuration: `instanceId`

Introduce the `instanceId` configuration for multi-master Gerrit setups.
For more details check:

* [Design doc](../../design-docs/instance-id.html)

* [Configuration](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.instanceId)

* [Trace event origin](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/dev-plugins.html#_trace_event_origin)

### Other performance optimizations

- Ability to configure the number of relevant changes to consider when suggesting
the reviewers on the changes screen, using the `gerrit.config` setting
[`suggest.relevantChanges`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html#suggest.relevantChanges)

### PolyGerrit UI

The Gerrit frontend has been migrated from Polymer 2 to
[Polymer 3](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/upgrade).

* Users can now cherry pick entire topics.

* Gerrit supports adding display names. Hosts can configure first name or username as default.

* The reply dialog now shows the entire comment thread instead of the comment list.

* [Issue 6293](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6293):
More self-evident transitions from WIP state. "Start Review" button added to change view.

* [Issue 8153](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8153):
Improvements to rebase indicator: display a hover card instead of a tooltip with the icon
including the possible rebase action.

* [Issue 10444](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10444):
UI for deleting change messages for Gerrit Administrators.

* [Issue 10890](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10890):
Repository list: Move "Repository Browser" column left of "Description" column.

* [Issue 11441](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11441):
Add in-product reminder to keep discussions respectful.

  Some code review discussions can become a bit rough and some people perceived
  discussions as not always respectful.
  Add an in-product reminder to keep discussions respectful when a reply is typed,
  optionally with linking to the code of conduct.

* [Issue 11493](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11493):
Add an "Edit" button to the diff view in the PolyGerrit UI.

* [Issue 11521](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11521):
Display trace ID in error popup if request failed and server did a trace.

* [Issue 11522](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11522):
REST API for review labels in the project configuration.

* [Issue 11705](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11705):
Show count of changes in User Dashboard.

* [Issue 11706](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11706):
Allow editing the commit message as part of a change edit.

* [Issue 11973](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11973):
Add copy-to-clipboard for generated HTTP password.

* [Issue 12364](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12364):
Add support for going to a specific line number in the inline editor.

### Download commands plugin

* [Issue 11594](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11594)
Merge the repo-vs-git logic into GitDownloadCommand directly.

   Created separate "getRepoCommand" and "getCommand" methods for
   downstream classes to extend with the default "getRepoCommand"
   defaulting to null.

* [Issue 11609](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11609)
"Download patch" UI includes an option for also creating a local branch.

  A very standard workflow is to download a change from Gerrit then want
  to make edits and then repo upload the changes back to Gerrit.
  Allow developers who are not familiar with the idiosyncrasies of repo,
  to easily create a local branch when checking out changes.

### End-to-end tests

* Allow end-to-end tests to proportionally scale on their expected execution times.

  A `power_factor` [environment property](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html#_environment_properties)
  was added to the end-to-end tests core framework. Using that optional property,
  scenario steps can take some more (or less) time prior to expecting proper completion.

  The way to set that property locally then depends on the target runtime environment,
  or SUT latency. The property may be used for either core or plugin scenarios.

* `FlushProjectsCache` related scenarios added to core (and the `high-availability` plugin).

* Support for relative runtime weights in scenarios.

  Each scenario can now either weight like any other by default, or override that default
  with a greater weight value, compared to siblings that are lighter on execution times.

  Beside core, make the `high-availability` and `multi-site` plugin scenarios reuse this.

* Allow scenarios to create and delete Gerrit changes alongside projects.

  Add the corresponding core support for an optional `http` request body to every such
  `GerritSimulation`. Either automate or allow [environment properties](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-e2e-tests.html#_environment_properties)
  to feed the related input test data.

  Beside core, make the `high-availability` and `multi-site` plugin scenarios test changes
  that way. The latter currently has [Issue 12693](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12693)
  as a known limitation.

### REST APIs

* Accounts

  * `display_name` field added to all the endpoints returning the account details.

  * [New Set Display Name](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#set-display-name) API for updating the account display name.

  * New [Modify Account](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
    global capability is now required for
    [List Accounts Emails](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#list-account-emails),
    [Get Account External IDs](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#get-account-external-ids) and
    [Delete Account External IDs](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids)
    when used to access information that belongs to accounts other than the caller.

* Changes

  * [Query Changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#list-changes)
  API now supports a new `no-limit` parameter to remove the default limit on queries and return
  all results. This might not be supported by all index backends.
  Also, the `SKIP_MERGEABLE` option for skipping the mergeability flag option is not supported anymore.

  * [Revert Change](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#revert-change)
  now truncates the revert message if it exceeds 63 characters, by cutting it down to 59 characters
  with the ellipsis (`…​`) in the end.
  Also, the API requires now the new revert permission, otherwise a `403 Forbidden` status code is returned.

  * [Revert Submission](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#revert-submission)
  API for creating a submission-id for grouping multiple changes that belong to the same submission
  (e.g. topic submission).

  * [Change file content in Change Edit](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#put-edit-file)
  API supports now uploading binary content.

  * New [Preview Fix](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-changes.html#preview-fix)
  API for gettings the diffs of all files for a certain fix-id. This is intended to be used in conjunction
  with robot comments.

  * New `allow_conflicts` option in all REST-API that perform a server-side merge or cherry-pick.

* Groups

  * [Query Groups](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-groups.html#query-groups)
  API accepts the `query` as parameter for groups filtering, instead of the `query2` which was
  a temporary name given to avoid clashes with an earlier deprecated parameter.

* Projects

  * Brand-new set of [Label Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/rest-api-projects.html#label-endpoints)
  API for managing the project review labels in a programmatic way, without having
  to directly modify directly the `project.config` in the `refs/meta/config` of
  the repository.

  Merge commit cannot be moved

     If a merge was targetting branch A, but then it was decided to create
     a new branch for this merge named B, which starts from A - The merge
     is still valid for B, and the user has no way to move it without amending
     and creating a new change.

  * [Issue 15024](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15024):

### 3.2.12

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 14732](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14732):
  Commits/IncludedIn exposes branch names without respecting the ACLs on branches

     When calling the REST endpoint for listing all branches that a commit SHA1
     is part of, the commit is properly checked for visibility against the ACLs
     (it is a REST resource) but the branches are not checked.

     The included-in may expose the list of non-visible branches to a user that
     has visibility of the SHA1.

  * [Issue 7282](https://crbug.com/gerrit/7282):
  Hide repository name and description when user has no access

     Gitiles did not respect Gerrit's permission and would show the repo name
     and description to any user who could guess the name.
     The repositories list as well as the content APIs were not affected.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 14785](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14785):
  Limit returned changes for a triplet without Change-Id

    Fix a bug where invoking the REST-API /changes/repo~branch~ without
    mentioning the change-id resulted in the full scan of all changes
    on a repository/branch causing a high CPU overload and occupying
    the request threads for a long time.

  * [Issue 14776](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14776):
  Prevent removing e-mail associated with OpenID external IDs

    Gerrit prevents the user from removing the email address
    associated with their OpenId account.

  * [Change 312602](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/312602):
  Fix Mariadb status matching for AccountPatchReview

    Mariadb connector uses SQLException.getSQLState() which returns the ANSI
    SQLSTATE value, not the MariaDB/mysql error code.
    Fix the removal of duplicate key detection when an already reviewed file
    opened up again returned 500 because of the incorrect handling of SQLSTATE
    value.

  * [Change 312382](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/312382):

    Avoids gerrit.sh killing the in-flight Git/HTTP just after 30 seconds regardless of
    the `httpd.gracefulStopTimeout` configuration value.

  * [Issue 14639](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14639):
  Searching repositories by name is case-sensitive

    Restore the correct project search that was case-insensitive in 2.16.27,
    3.1.3 and 3.3.2.

  * [Issue 14645](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14645):

### 3.2.10

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 14553](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14553):
  Gerrit REST-API fails when using /a/ prefix and cookies

    Recent fix to support GerritAccount Cookie authentication for Git/HTTP
    broke existing Python (or other) scripting when performing automation with
    Gerrit REST-API. That is due to the generation of the GerritAccount cookie
    in the HTTP response, which Python automatically manages to reuse in
    subsequent calls.

  * [Issue 13721](https://crbug.com/gerrit/13721):
  Don't serve polygerrit assets for git requests

    After migration to Polymer UI, PolyGerrit static resources are mounted at
    the root of the gerrit URL, and would collide with project namespaces, so that
    the project with these prefixes cannot be served with Git over HTTP protocol.

### 3.2.9 (withdrawn)

  * Fix `EqualsLabelPredicate` to not fail when calling match() from a plugin

    Calling `match()` on the `EqualsLabelPredicate` returned from
    `ChangeQueryBuilder.parse()` in a plugin fails when in the context of an
    HTTP query.

  * Fix registration redirect on OpenID

  * Log when a new SSH connection is rejected due to exceeded limit

  * [Issue 14127](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14127):
  Fix binding of DELETE REST calls from plugins.

    The processing of the DELETE request actually never reached the
    delete-project plugin due to bug in the RestApiServlet which wrongly
    delegated the request to a child collection in Gerrit core.

  * [Issue 13140](https://crbug.com/gerrit/13140):
  OpenID: Remove support for Yahoo! OpenID provider.

    Yahoo! discontinued support for OpenID provider:
    "OpenID2 will be EOLed on 6/30/20"

  * [Issue 14246](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14246):
  Creation of internal account does not respect `auth.userNameToLowerCase`.

    The CreateAccount SSH command and REST API was able to create accounts
    with usernames that contained uppercase letters even if
    `auth.userNameToLowerCase` was set to true.

  * [Issue 14490](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14490):
  Missing LDAP metrics for authentication.

    Expose the LDAP metrics in terms of latency and call rates so that any
    problem can be highlighted early on and potentially alerted to the Gerrit
    admin.

  * [Issue 14497](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14497):
  Git/HTTP traffic overloads LDAP with duplicate authentication requests.

    When authenticating incoming Git calls over HTTP the BasicAuth filter was
    called 3 times per call triggering multiple authentications against the
    backend.

  * [Issue 14508](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14508):
  Allow GerritAccount Cookie authentication for Git/HTTP.

    Allow to create a Gerrit session from the GerritAccount cookie set on the
    Git client, so that only the first HTTP call will actually authenticate
    and create a session whilst all the others would just reuse the existing
    cookie.

  * [Issue 11142](https://crbug.com/gerrit/11142):
  ssh to gerrit with no args requires standard input to terminate.

  * [JGit Issue 552173](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=552173)
  Too many open files when fetching repos with lots of refs

    JGit update fixes "Too many open files" errors.

  Polygerrit: Remove license headers in minified gr-app.js.

* Replication plugin fixes

  * Don't check read permission when authgroup isn't set.

    Do not check for read permission when authGroup is not set since
    the user is a RemoteSiteUser that is-an InternalUser having
    read access to everything. This fixes a regression introduced in v3.1.10
    that prevented the All-Users.git repository to be fully replicated to
    Gerrit replicas.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 13803](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13803):
  Limit number of ambiguous accounts in error message.

### 3.2.6

* Breaking Changes

  * Elasticsearch: Support for [EOL version](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
    6.8 is discontinued. This was the last supported minor version of
    Elasticsearch 6 in Gerrit. From this release, Gerrit no longer supports V6
    but only the already supported versions 7.x of Elasticsearch.

    * Speaking of which, support for 7.0 and 7.1 is discontinued too, as both
      elasticsearch versions also became [EOL](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
      recently.

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 12629](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12629):
  Verify hostname when sending emails via SMTP server with SMTPSClient.

    The SMTP server's certificate and hostname must be verified if
    encryption is enabled with SSL verification in the host settings
    (`sendemail.smtpEncryption` and `sendemail.sslVerify`).

* PolyGerrit Fixes

  * Add a warning if submitting a change with an open change edit.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 13544](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13544)
  Ensure that GC#deleteOrphans respects pack lock:

    If pack or index files are guarded by a pack lock (.keep file)
    deleteOrphans() should not touch the respective files protected by the
    lock file.

  * [Issue 13775](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13775)
  Honor `toogleWipState` permission for `%ready` `%wip` push options:

  * [Issue 13781](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13781)
  Compact the REST-API output JSON unconditionally:

    The output JSON was initially compacted only when
    the Accept header was set to `application/json`: the compaction is now
    done unconditionally, unless the `pp=1` query parameter is specified.

  * [Issue 13786](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13786)
  ForRef#check should permit internal users to read all refs:

    [Make `PermissionBackend#ForRef` authoritative change](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/288925)
    introduced a regression where gerrit `internal users` (e.g. plugins) were
    not taken into consideration when checking READ permission. As consequence
    the `All-Users.git` repository did not get any of the user's refs replicated
    to the slaves. After the upgrade it is required to trigger a forced replication
    of the `All-Users.git` repository manually.

  * Avoid logging ssh exception for __stream is already closed__ when length=0
    if present in the stacktrace.

* Documentation Updates

  * Clarify that 'm' push option sets patch set description.

  * Clarify that disk cache metrics require `cache.enableDiskStatMetrics`.

* Dependency Updates

  * Upgrade Bazel toolchain to 3.1.0.

  * Upgrade testcontainers to 1.15.1.

  * Upgrade Jetty to 9.4.33.v20201020.

  Java runtime mismatch on Java 8 since after upgrading to v3.2.5.

### 3.2.5

* Breaking Changes

  * Elasticsearch: Support for [EOL versions](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
    6.6 and 6.7 is discontinued.

  * [Issue 13184](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13184):
  Logging: `--console-log`-flag of `gerrit.war daemon` respects `log.textLogging`
    and `log.jsonLogging` options

    Change in the default behaviour of the `--console-log` flag. Since
    `log.textLogging` in the `gerrit.config` is `true` by default, using the
    `--console-log`-flag now writes logs to the `error_log`-file in addition
    to stderr by default. This can be avoided by setting `log.textLogging = false`.

  * [Issue 13701](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13701):
  X-Forwarded-Proto is now required because of underlying upgrade of the Jetty library,
  when Gerrit is accessed through an HTTP(/S) reverse-proxy.

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 13621](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13621)
    [CVE-2020-8919](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8919):
  Make `PermissionBackend#ForRef` authoritative.

    Fixes a misconception that leads to data being accessible through Gerrit
    APIs that should be locked down.

    Gerrit had two components for determining if a Git ref is visible to a
    user: `(Default)RefFilter` and `PermissionBackend#ForRef` (e.g.,
    `RefControl`). The former was always capable of providing correct results
    for all refs. The latter only had logic to decide if a Git ref is visible
    according to the Gerrit `READ` permissions. This includes all refs under
    `refs/heads` as well as any other ref that isn't a database ref or a Git
    tag. This component was unaware of Git tags and notedb-related refs. Hence,
    when asked for a database reference such as `refs/changes/xx/yyyyxx/meta`,
    the logic would allow access if the user has `READ` permissions on any of
    the ref prefixes (such as the default "read refs/* Anonymous Users").

    That was problematic, because it bypassed
    [documented behavior](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.5/access-control.html)
    where a user should only have access to a change if he can see the
    destination ref. The same goes for other database references.

  * [Issue 13514](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13514)
    [CVE-2020-8920](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8920):
  Work around Gitiles bug on `All-Users` visibility.

    Gitiles has a special `FilteredRepository` wrapper that allows carefully
    hiding refs based on the project's ACLs. There is however an optimization
    that skips the filtering in case a user has `READ` permissions on every ACL
    pattern(s). When the target repository is `All-Users`, the optimization
    turns into a security issue because it allows seeing all personal information
    associated with all accounts, i.e.:

    * draft comments
    * draft edits
    * personally identifiable information (PII) of all users
    * external ids

    This fix now blocks Gitiles or any other part of Gerrit to abuse this power
    when the target repository is `All-Users`, where nobody can be authorized
    to skip the ACLs evaluation anyway.
