## Release Highlights

* GWT UI is deprecated, and PolyGerrit is now the default UI.

* Experimental Dark Mode in PolyGerrit.

* Inline editing support in PolyGerrit UI.

* Redesigned UI for PolyGerrit based on material design.

* New configuration option to ignore self-approval on labels.

* New CommonMark/Markdown parser.

## Important Notes

### Known problem with schema upgrade

When a gerrit site older than 2.15 is migrated to 2.16, then schema
migration should be first performed to the latest 2.15.x release.

To upgrade to the latest 2.15.x release:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit-2.15.latest.war init -d ${site_path}
```

### Known problem with plugins and index

Since 2.14.2 the plugins are loaded before online reindexing is started, so
that prolog rules provided by plugins can be invoked during indexing. See
[issue 6472](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6472) for
details.

This causes a problem for any plugins that access the index either directly
or indirectly (i.e. by accessing a cache), because the index is not yet
available when the plugin is loaded during server startup. An example of this
is in the replication plugin, which needs to use the group cache when
`authGroup` is used in a destination configuration.

A fix [issue 10082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10082)
is available since 2.16.3 release.

### Migration to NoteDb

[NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html)
is now required for accounts (since 2.15) and groups (since 2.16), and is the preferred storage for changes.

In Gerrit 2.15:
* Account data (with the exception of Group data) was moved to NoteDB ([release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2.15.html#notedb-for-accounts)).
* Change data could be either moved to NoteDB ([migration process](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/note-db.html#migration)), or left in ReviewDB.

In Gerrit 2.16:
* Group data is always moved to NoteDB (it is migrated automatically during the upgrade process, when you run `gerrit.war init`).

When upgrading to Gerrit v2.16, you are strongly advised to migrate fully (including changes) from ReviewDb to NoteDb.

You should review the documentation on [NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html),
including the information about the migration process:

- [On-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#online-migration)
- [Off-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#offline-migration)

Although ReviewDb is still technically available on Gerrit v2.16, the upgrade to NoteDb is strongly recommended, although not enforced.

Note that in the next version of Gerrit (v3.0), ReviewDb will not be available.

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d ${site_path}
```

### Reindex for new projects index and changed group index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d ${site_path}
```

The group index gained two new fields, which Gerrit 2.16 depends on. For this
reason, the following command to offline reindex the group index must be
executed as well:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index groups -d ${site_path}
```

The offline reindex for groups should also be run on Gerrit slave hosts.

Note that if you are migrating from v2.15, it is not necessary to reindex the changes and accounts indexes
offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer after
starting Gerrit.

### Support for GWT UI is deprecated

From 2.16 GWT UI is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

### Support for Velocity templates removed

In [version 2.14](2.14.md) support for Soy templates was added. For backwards
compatibility, support for Velocity templates (VTL) was kept.

In version 2.16 support for VTL is completely removed. Site administrators must
replace any Velocity templates (`.vm` files in `$site/etc/mail/`) with the equivalent
Soy templates before upgrading to this version.

### Push to refs/changes is deprecated

The possibility to push to `refs/changes` is now disabled by default.  It is
still possible to enable it in the gerrit config by setting
[receive.allowPushToRefsChanges](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-gerrit.html#receive.allowPushToRefsChanges)
to true.

### Legacy `/p/` prefix for Git/HTTP projects is removed

The `/p/` cannot be used anymore and the `/a/` prefix should be used for Git/HTTP
with basic authentication.

### DELETE requests with bodies are no longer recommended

Some proxies, which are not under client control, prohibit DELETE requests with
bodies. DELETE requests with bodies could work on a first attempt, but could
fail afterwards because a server they have no control over was updated. In this
case, client users could be in trouble if they were not notified.

Therefore, we have decided to no longer recommend sending DELETE requests with
bodies. They will continue to work in this release but should be considered as
deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Pegdown is replaced by Flexmark

[flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) is a Java implementation of
CommonMark 0.28 spec parser using the blocks first, inlines after Markdown parsing
architecture.

Its strengths are speed, flexibility, Markdown source element based AST with details
of the source position down to individual characters of lexemes that make up the
element and extensibility, compared to Pegdown speed that was, in general, less than
ideal and for pathological input either hangs or practically hangs during parsing.

### SYSTEM_CONFIG table is removed

This table was used to retrieve the `site_path` directory in unattended setup
mode. As a replacement, system property `gerrit.site_path` should be used.

### Git clients older than 2.x are not supported anymore

The Gerrit hook script for adding the Change-Id in every local commit has been
simplified and is now using the git-interpret-trailers command.
The interpret trailers command is available as of git v2.2.0, released
Dec 2014.

Existing cloned repositories that have been cloned before the migration to v2.16
and thus having the old hook for generating the Change-Id will continue to work.
However, new clones and hook scripts will need to upgrade your local git client
to v2.2.0 or later.

If you have existing older git clients and cannot migrate to v2.2.0 or later, you need
to keep serving the old script, copying it to the Gerrit /static directory, and
then amend the Gerrit helper instructions to download it.

Example (assuming Gerrit installed on $GERRIT_SITE and available at https://gerrit.mycompany.com):

```
$ curl 'https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.15/gerrit-server/src/main/resources/com/google/gerrit/server/tools/root/hooks/commit-msg?format=TEXT' > $GERRIT_SITE/static/commit-msg
$ git config -f $GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config gerrit.installCommitMsgHookCommand 'gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); curl -o ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg https://gerrit.mycompany.com/static/commit-msg ; chmod +x ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg'
```

### `current_user` predicate is removed from the submit rule evaluator

As a consequence of this, the result of a submittability check can no
longer depend on the user who is asking for it. For example it is no
longer possible to define a submit rule that would enforce that only
change owners can submit a change. This should instead be achieved by
using the 'Change Owners' group in a permission rule.

## New Features

### 'Read As' capability

The new ['Read As' capability](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.3/access-control.html#capability_readAs)
allows users to impersonate any user to see which refs they can see.

Note: the capability was added in 2.16 but only documented since 2.16.1.

### Disable log file rotation and compression

On sites where log file rotation and compression is done by an external
service such as [logrotate](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man8/logrotate.8.html),
administrators may wish to disable Gerrit's default log rotation and
compression.

This can now be done by setting
[`log.rotate`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-gerrit.html#log.rotate)
and [`log.compress`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-gerrit.html#log.compress)
to `false`.

Both settings default to `true` when not set, to maintain consistent behavior
with previous releases.

### PolyGerrit enhancements

#### Repo access view

- [Issue 6569](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6569)
  Add repo access view.

PolyGerrit UI displays the repository access information and allows editing it.

#### Inline edit
- [Issue 4437](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4437)
  inline edit is fully implemented using the CodeMirror Editor plugin.

  A new core plugin, `codemirror-editor`, is available,
  which uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) to provide a rich code editing
  experience in PolyGerrit.

  When you upgrade Gerrit using `init -d`, you are given the option to install the
  `codemirror-editor` plugin.

#### Differences from GWT

- Writing a cover message on a specific patch set is no longer possible.

  The cover message is always added on the current patch set. This means
  that any system that relies on notifications being sent for a specific
  patch set will no longer work.

### New logging framework

For logging Gerrit is now using [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger)
instead of SLF4J. The logging backend is still LOG4J.

The Flogger LOG4J backend is configured by a system property
(`flogger.backend_factory=com.google.common.flogger.backend.log4j.Log4jBackendFactory#getInstance`)
that must be set for logging to work. There is an init step that automatically
sets this system property in the `gerrit.config` file and in addition Gerrit
tries to set this system property automatically on startup if it isn't set yet.
However for some setups you may need to do additional actions to make sure that
this system property is set.

In addition there is a system property that needs to be set for
[request tracing](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html)
(`flogger.logging_context=com.google.gerrit.server.logging.LoggingContext#getInstance`).
Also this system property is automatically set in the `gerrit.config` file by an
init step and in addition Gerrit tries to set this system property automatically
on startup if it isn't set yet. However for some setups you may need to do
additional actions to make sure that this system property is set.

SLF4J can still be used by plugins, but using SLF4J in plugins is deprecated and
with the next Gerrit release SLF4J will no longer be exported as part of the
Gerrit plugin API jar. This means from the next release onwards, plugins must either
migrate to Flogger or have an own dependency on SLF4J.


### REST API

There are several new REST endpoints and additions to existing endpoints, as described in the [REST API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api.html) documentation.

See below an overview of the noteworthy changes.

#### [Access Rights Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html)

* [`ProjectAccessInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html#project-access-info)
  has a new field `configWebLinks` containing a list of URLs that display the history
  of the configuration file governing this project’s access rights.

#### [Accounts Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html)

* [Query accounts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#query-account)
  requires the [Modify Account](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
  permission to return all the emails associated with the account.

* New endpoint [`/drafts.delete`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#_delete_draft_comments)
  to remove the drafts comments associated with an account.

#### [Changes Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html)

  [get](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#get-change-message)
  and [delete](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#delete-change-message)
  the messages `/messages` of a change including the detailed
  account information associated.

* New endpoint [`/cherrypick`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#cherry-pick)
  to cherry-pick a specific commit.

#### [Config Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html)

* New endpoint [`/server/reload`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#reload-config)
  to reload Gerrit configuration.

* New endpoint [`/server/preferences.edit`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#get-edit-preferences)
  to retrieve and update the global edit preferences for the server.

#### [Groups Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html)

* New option [`?ownedBy`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html#_find_groups_that_are_owned_by_another_group)
  to find groups that are owned by another group

#### [Project Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html)

* New option `?state` to get [all projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#suggest-projects)
  with the given state.

* New option [`?query`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#query-projects)
  for querying projects limited to a maximum of `?limit` entries.

* New endpoint `/description` for [updating](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#set-project-description)
  and [deleting](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#delete-project-description) the project's description.

* [Check project access](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access)
  endpoint is now a GET API while the [POST is still supported by deprecated](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access-post).

* New endpoint to index a project [`/index`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index)
  and all the changes [`/index.changes`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index.changes)
  associated to it.

* New endpoint [`/check`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check)
  to check project's consistency.

#### [Commit Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#commit-endpoints)

* New endpoint [`/files`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#list-files)
  to list files associated with a commit.

### Request Tracing

If a request is traced the unique trace ID is attached to all logs that are triggered
by the request. In addition all logs are enforced regardless of the configured log level.
Given the trace ID an administrator can find the trace in the error log and debug issues more
easily.

Detailed information about request tracing can be found in the
[request tracing documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html).

### New configuration option to ignore self approval on labels

A new option for Review Labels,
[label.Label-Name.ignoreSelfApproval](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-labels.html#label_ignoreSelfApproval),
is available.

If true, the label may be voted on by the uploader of the latest patch set, but their approval does not make a change submittable. Instead, a non-uploader who has the right to vote has to approve the change.

It defaults to `false`, but one possible use case is to set the value to `true` for the `Code-Review` label in the `All-Projects` project.
That value will then be inherited by all projects that do not override the `Code-Review` label settings.

## Bug Fixes

* [Issue 10106](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10106):

  removing duplicate code in the RestApiServlet. Rest{Create,DeleteMissing}View are renamed to RestCollection{Create,DeleteMissing}View.
  See the [relevant change for more details](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/Id2289a51c7d55bd61222ac132084e7f87328504c).

* Support binding a RestView to delete a missing resource through a brand-new [`DeleteViewBinder`](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.16/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/restapi/RestApiModule.java).
  See the [relevant change for more details](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/If64224d502bbfe578133d1255b42902dd4fbe4fb)

* New Api and REST endpoint to reindex a project on [`ProjectApi`](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.16/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/api/projects/ProjectApi.java).

* New [RestCollection{Create,Delete,Modify}View](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.16/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/restapi/RestCollectionCreateView.java)
  that can be bound for POST and DELETE requests on collections
  via RestApiModule. The AcceptPost interface is not available anymore and existing code making use of it needs
  to be adapted to use the RestCollectionView.

* Support getting account details in [`AccountApi`](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.16/java/com/google/gerrit/extensions/api/accounts/AccountApi.java).

  * Make DefaultChangeReportFormatter extendible by plugins.

  * Make the wording of the "Change Merged" email templates consistent between the
  HTML and text versions.

  * Add a `.gitreview` file.

    For developers used to using the [git-review tool](https://pypi.org/project/git-review/)

    if the specified base change is missing.

  * Fix detecting changes of parent trees when computing change kind for merge commit.

    A new patch set of a merge change is considered as NO_CHANGE if the

  * Improve handling of remote repository creation failures.

  * Reintroduce boolean return value of methods in AdminApi.

  * Refactor AdminApiFactory to an interface with a default implementation that

  * When rescheduling due to in-flight push also log the in-flight task ID.

### 2.16.10

* [Issue 11016](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11016):
Fix failure to initialize on slave.

* [Issue 10763](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10763):
Fix ACLs to allow regexes for tag and ref permissions.

  The documentation states that reference names can also be described with
  a regular expression by prefixing the reference name with `^`, but the UI
  only showed the creation field when a non-regex name was used.

* [Issue 11082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11082):
Close changes oldest first when submitting on push.

* [Issue 11059](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11059):

* [Issue 11110](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11110):
Do not swallow the exceptions that caused REST-API to return with a status >= 400.

* [Issue 11086](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11086):
When a WIP change is implicitly merged by direct push to the branch, its WIP
state is unset.

* Show submit button with tooltip when not allowed to submit.

  The submit button was hidden when the user did not have permission to submit,
  or other conditions prevented submit (for example the change being WIP).

* Allow commit validation listeners to ignore the `skip-validation` push option.

  Gerrit allows certain users to skip validation of new commits by passing
  the `skip-validation` push option.

  A new method `shouldValidateAllCommits` is added on the
  `CommitValidationListener`, to allow plugin implemented validators to
  override this option and always be invoked for new commits. The new
  method has a default implementation that returns `false` meaning that
  existing implementations don't need to be modified and will behave the
  same as before.

* Optimize commit and ref operation validation for non-ff push.

  On a non-ff push all the commits were validated before the ref operation
  was validated. On a push with many commits, validating all the commits is
  wasteful in the case where the ref operation is rejected. The logic is
  changed so that the ref operation validation is performed before the commit
  validation.

* Disallow change index task duplication.

  It was possible for multiple index tasks to be queued for the same change.

* Fix formatting issues and inconsistencies in soy email templates.

* Use URL Formatter interface to generate URL in outgoing emails.

* Fix error message when JRE is not found when starting Gerrit.

  The error message recommended to check for a JRE ">= 1.7", but Gerrit requires
  Java 8 minimum.

* Expose the `createProject` method of the `CreateProject` class to plugins.

  This allows plugins to directly invoke the project creation, avoiding the
  checks that are performed when invking via the `apply` method.

* Expose the jsr305 library in the plugin API.

* PolyGerrit UI fixes:

  * Only display 404 page on initial load.

  * Don't reload when viewing dashboard.

  * Fix hiding the HTTP password screen.

    It was possible for the HTTP password to be un-hidden using CSS.

  * Add an extension point to allow adding links to the user header.

  * Add extension point to the footer so that users can add links to their
  Privacy policy or Code of conduct.

  * Fix dialog popup when going to /admin/create-project.

* Elasticsearch fixes:

  * Support for Elasticsearch 7.2 and and upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 7.2.0.

  * [Issue 10499](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10499):
  Set default number of shards according to Elasticsearch version.

    In Elasticsearch version 7.0 the default number of shards was reduced from
    5 to 1.

    See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-concepts.html#getting-started-shards-and-replicas)
    for details.

### 2.16.9

* Improve performance of migration of accounts to schema 146.

  * Migration of the accounts is parallelized. The default number of threads
    used is the number of available processors. This can be customized using
    the `threadcount` system property.

  * Before the migration, `gc --prune=now` is executed.

  * When hosted on `FileRepository`, refs are packed after migration of every
    1000 accounts.

  * A progress indicator counts every 100 accounts migrated.

* [Issue 10790](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10790):
Avoid evaluating submit rules twice for open changes.

  Prolog submit rules were evaluated twice per page view for an open change,
  which caused performance degradation on projects defining complex rules.

* [Issue 10943](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10943):
Set `References:` header on new change notification mail.

  GMail changed the way
  [emails are grouped in conversation view](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/03/threading-changes-in-gmail-conversation-view.html),
  which, combined with the fact that
  [Amazon SES changes the `Message-ID` header](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=262855),
  resulted in the new change notification email not being grouped with
  subsequent emails related to the same change.

* [Issue 10896](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10896):
Fix eliding project name without slash in notification emails.

* [Issue 10920](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10920):
Fix commit date of initial empty commit when creating new project.

  The commit date of the initial commit was the server start time, rather than
  the date of the actual commit.

* [Issue 10952](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10952):
Fix definition of `PID` in `gerrit.sh`.

* Don't send "GPG keys added" notification when no GPG keys were added.

  A GPG key update can include both addition and removal of GPG keys. The
  notification email for addition of new keys was always sent, even if the
  update only removed keys.

* Update email notifications on changing security related settings.

  Email notifications are now sent when a GPG or SSH key is removed, and
  when the HTTP password is deleted or changed.

  An email notification is now always sent when an SSH key is added to an
  account, even when it was added by an administrator.

  These notifications allow to alert the user if their account is compromised
  and keys or password are altered by the attacker.

* Remove explicit dependency on protobuf_java.

  The protobuf_java library is now consumed from rules_closure.

* Add methods to generate and set the HTTP password on the accounts API.

* Don't send "GPG keys added" notification when no GPG keys were added.

  A GPG key update can include both the addition and removal of GPG keys. The
  notification email for the addition of new keys was always sent, even if the
  update only removed keys.

* Add methods to generate and set the HTTP password on the accounts API.

* [Issue 10664](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10664):
Fix duplicate key detection when using MySQL for the patch review store.

  Retrieve the error code number from the SQL exception to
  correctly detect and ignore a duplicate key error.

* LDAP: support servers that do not allow anonymous browsing.

  Add `ldap.supportAnonymous` configuration setting in gerrit.config to support
  servers that do not allow anonymous browsing. Default is true per standard and
  best practice.

* Elasticsearch fixes

  * [Issue 10496](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10496) and
  [Issue 10844](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10884):

  Fix replacement of file content when navigating between files with `[` and `]`.

  * Upgrade polymer-resin to 2.0.1.

  * [Issue 10670](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10670):
  Fix selection of merge base when navigating between merge commit changes.

    When navigating between merge commit changes, the selection of the merge base was not persisted.

  * Hide overflowing author element content.

    In the case of vertical stacking Unicode characters, it was possible for
    the text to overflow out of the element and into other details on the
    review page.

    That is a partial fix for the problem described in
    [issue 10795](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10795).

  * [Issue 10744](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10744):
  Fix display of "Show More" after change screen reloaded.

  * [Issue 10757](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10757):
  Fix handling of "Automatically mark viewed files reviewed" preference.

    Files were automatically marked as reviewed even when the setting was
    disabled.

  * [Issue 10549](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10549):
  Fix single tab indentation in diff view.

  * Use dom-if instead of CSS when hiding the user's password in the element
    `gr-http-password`, to prevent users from using CSS to reshow the
    password screen.

  * Hide project-aware top menus from the header.

  * Upgrade highlightjs for syntax highlighting fixes:

     - Treat `False`, `None` and `True` as literals in python.

     - Fully support C++11 raw strings in cpp.

* Core plugins

  * Replication plugin: Fix internal server error when username or password not
    specified for remote.

    The username and password are both optional, but the replication plugin
    failed with a null pointer exception if either of them was omitted.

  * codemirror-plugin: upgraded to the latest revision on master, which includes
    the following fixes and improvements:

    - Bazel: Fix lint warning flagged by buildifier

    - Add .mailmap

    - Remove CodeMirror modes that are not supported at Google

  * Clarify that account must have a username to be able to set HTTP password.

  * Fix formatting in project config documentation.

### 2.16.8

* [Issue 10695](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10695):
Upgrade JGit to 5.1.7.201904200442-r to fix regression in packfile list
handling.

  If `core.trustfolderstat` was set to `false`, an infinite loop could occur
  when an object was not found in the packfile.

* Add support for Elasticsearch 6.7.x and 7.0.x.

  The elasticsearch-rest-client is upgraded to 7.0.0.

* Don't abort auto-abandoning if one change failed.

  When failing to query a single change during auto-abandoning, the whole
  process was aborted. Now the failure is logged and the process continues
  to attempt to abandon subsequent changes.

* [Issue 10693](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10693):
Avoid empty item in list of conflicting files on cherry-picking a change.

* Fix leak of temp files during merge operations.

  `TemporaryBuffer` instances created during merge operations could leave
  undeleted temporary files in the file system.

* Improve logging of invalid schedule values, and clarify documentation.

  When a schedule value, for example `gc.startTime` or `gc.interval`, was
  configured, the error message in the log was not helpful. This is now
  improved to include more information about what was wrong.

  Additionally, the documentation is updated to clarify that the hour
  value in times must be zero-padded.

* Install `AddKeyHtml.soy` template example during installation.

  The installation of this template into `$site_path/etc/mail` was
  omitted.

* Upgrade Flogger to version 0.4.

Fix syntax highlighting for Verilog/SystemVerilog.

* Fix that an endpoint cannot be used by two plugins anymore.

  'name' does not exist on the plugin object, so the _initializedPlugins map
  would store undefined=>true for the first plugin and then not allow any
  further plugins.

  For example the change-view-integration could not be used by buildbucket and
  tricium anymore.

* [Issue 10587](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10587):
Fix setting group visibility.

##### Other Fixes

* [Issue 10562](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10562):
Upgrade JGit to 5.1.6.201903130242-r to fix corruption of packfile
list due to concurrent access during GC.

  See [JGit issue 544199](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544199)
  for details.

* [Issue 10591](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10591):
Fix account and group query with Elasticsearch 6.

  The wrong document type was used in the request URL, causing the query to
  return no results.

* [Issue 7192](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7192):
Strip trailing slashes from name when creating repository.

* [Issue 10568](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10568):
Add `is:submittable` to search suggestions.

* [Issue 10600](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10600):
Fix `commit-msg` hook to abort commit when commit message is empty.

* Allow the `@LogThreshold` annotation to be inherited.

* Fix documentation of hashtag: search predicate.

  The documentation incorrectly stated that the search was an exact match.

### 2.16.6

#### New features

* New configuration option: `gerrit.primaryWeblinkName`.

  The new configuration option allows to specify the name of the link the UI
  should use when multiple weblink providers are available but only one single
  link may be shown on the UI.

* New configuration option: `gerrit.listProjectsFromIndex`.

  The new configuration option allows restoring the legacy behavior of using
  the in-memory cache for rendering the list of projects. When set to true
  the list of projects is rendered using the secondary index and thus is limited
  by the queryLimits.

  By default is set to false, the in-memory cache is used as an engine for listing
  and thus returns all the projects without limits.

#### PolyGerrit UI changes

* Gitiles change-weblink with default weblink name ("browse") is now inline.

  If available a weblink that links to a code-browser is displayed inline
  on the change screen. Previously weblinks were only considered links to
  code-browsers if their name was one of "gitweb","gitiles". Weblinks with
  name "browse" are now also considered to be links to code-browsers and are
  displayed inline (href of current patchset and parent SHA1s) unless gitweb
  is available and configured as gerrit.primaryWeblinkName.

#### Plugins API

* New annotation @LogThreshold for setting a logging level during the execution
  of the tests. By default is set to DEBUG for backward compatibility.

#### Bug fixes

##### PolyGerrit

* [Issue 10467](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10467):
Fix hard-coded title for mark reviewed/unreviewed button.

  The button title was always "Mark as reviewed" even when the change was
  already marked as reviewed.

* [Issue 10155](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10155):
Exclude WIP changes from 'Assigned Changes' dashboard.

* Fix support for xml syntax highlighting.

* Add commit container gr endpoint for plugins.

* Fix missing `</section>` in gr-settings-view.

##### Other Fixes

* [Issue 10512](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10512):
Include project name in change URL in `Reviewed-on:` footer in commit message.

* [Issue 10500](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10500):
Fix injection of `UrlFormatter` in plugins.

  In version 2.16.1 the binding of the `UrlFormatter` interface was changed to
  use `DynamicItem`, but several classes were still injecting it directly. As a
  result, when such a class got injected in a plugin, the plugin would fail to load.
  It was also not possible for a plugin to provide an alternative implementation of
  `UrlFormatter`, and the `DefaultChangeReportFormatter` always used the
  `DefaultUrlFormatter`.

* [Issue 10488](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10488):
Fix listing of GPG public keys.

  The GPG public keys were truncated in the output of the GPG key REST API
  endpoints.

* Fix authentication for LFS over SSH.

* Add logging of prolog rule reduction limits.

  The configured values of `rules.reductionLimit` and `rules.compileLimit`
  are logged at INFO level at server startup, and the effective value applied
  to a predicate is logged at DEBUG level.

* Improve error message when JRE cannot be found during site start.

* Suggest `--no-edit` option when `Change-Id` line is missing.

  When the `Change-Id` is missing, the commit can be amended without
  editing.

* Fix `commit-msg` hook to not add a Change-Id when `gerrit.createChangeId`
is disabled.

* Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 6.6.1.

### 2.16.5

#### New features

Allow searching for projects by parent project name, using the 'parent:foo' search operator in the query string.
See the [projects search operator documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/user-search-projects.html#search-operators)
for more details.

#### Dependency Updates

* [Issue 10024](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10024): Upgrade Jetty to 9.4.14.v20181114
  This version fixes a bug that prevents the go-import plugin from working

* [Issue 10279](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10279): Upgrade highlight.js to 9.14.0
  This version fixes highlighting when Dart's string interpolation feature is used.

#### Fixes

##### PolyGerrit

* Add warning that Javascript is required to use PolyGerrit.

* [Issue 10366](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10366):
  Fix loading topics that have unusual characters.

  Add "verilog" and "SystemVerilog" to the mime list, enabling syntax highlighting.

* [Issue 10309](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10309):
  Support for setting max/min value for "Query Limit" and "Batch Changes" on the project's access screen.

##### API Changes

* Add a method to get revision votes on the revision API.

* [Issue 10380](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10380):
  Use project index to render change list on GWT UI.

  __NOTE__: As a consequence of this change, the [list projects REST-API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/rest-api-projects.html#list-projects)
  and project list screen on GWT UI will be subject to the same [queryLimit capability settings](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/access-control.html#capability_queryLimit)
  as in the PolyGerrit UI. The same limit applies to the [gerrit ls-projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/cmd-ls-projects.html) command.

* [Issue 10382](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10382)
  DefaultMemoryCacheModule/DefaultMemoryCacheFactory are exported again in plugin API.

* [Issue 10401](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10401):
  Reimplement the project children API on top of the projects secondary index, which requires
  a significantly less amount of heap and CPU.

#### Other fixes

* Add support for Elasticsearch 6.6.

### 2.16.4

#### Reindex for projects, accounts and groups indexes.

Gerrit 2.16.4 includes a fix to the projects, accounts, and groups secondary indexes.
It is very unusual for Gerrit to require a reindex inside a point release.
However, this is an exception because it is the only solution to fix the list sorting
[Issue 10210](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10210) reported on PolyGerrit.

The reindex of projects, accounts and groups can be performed either offline or online.
For the offline reindex, make sure that Gerrit is not active and run the following commands:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d ${site_path}
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index groups   -d ${site_path}
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index accounts -d ${site_path}
```

The online reindex does not require any commands: upgrade the gerrit.war
and restart Gerrit.

**NOTE**: The online reindex for projects may take quite a long time and
require a substantial amount of heap memory to run. During the reindex operation,
Gerrit performance may be sluggish and, even after the reindex is complete,
it would take quite some time for the memory to be released.
It is thus recommended to perform the offline reindex, to avoid impacting the
server performance at startup and after the reindex is complete.

#### Fixes

##### PolyGerrit

* [Issue 8740](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8740):
  Disable deps.js requests in the index template to fix page load delay.

* [Issue 10371](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10371):
  Fix an issue where a saved edit would always restore the same content
  in subsequent edits of the same file, due to the cache not being erased.

* [Issue 9909](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9909):
  Do not crash PolyGerrit UI if permitted labels array is empty

* [Issue 10324](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10324):
  Allow plugins (e.g. delete-project) to control the cache invalidation
  and display new content immediately without refreshing the page.

* Fix broken links in gr-icons.html.

* [Issue 7669](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7669),
  [Issue 9614](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9614):
  Fix '/' getting typed in search bar when pressed.

* [Issue 10151](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10151):
  [Issue 10019](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10019):
  Fix the "delete" button visibility to allow branch deletion.

* [Issue 10317](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10317):
  Don't show "Same Topic" for only one change.

  When there is only one change in the topic, it doesn't add any value
  to show the "Same Topic" tab/section because it will always only include
  the currently viewed change.

  The query used to get the changes is modified to exclude the current
  change. This means that the "Same Topic" tab/section now only shows other
  changes in the same topic, but never the current change.

#### Other fixes
* [Issue 10326](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10326):
Fix excessive heap and CPU usage when listing projects.

* Create the `.git/hooks` folder in download commands.

* Add method to get related changes in the Changes API.

* Add method to get edit details in the Change Edit API.

  The new method allows to set the base revision, and request to include the
  files and download commands.

* Add `--skip-project` option to the `MigrateToNoteDb` command.

  This is useful when only a few projects should be skipped but all others
  should be migrated.

### 2.16.3

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262):
Upgrade JGit to 5.1.5.201812261915-r to fix validation of `wants` in
`git-upload-pack` for protocol v0 stateless transports.

  AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for `git-upload-pack` in protocol v0
  stateless transports, meaning that `wants` were not validated and
  a user could fetch anything that is pointed to by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1),
  as long as they could guess the object name.

* [Issue 10242](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10242):
Fix regression that allows a user's account to be taken over when multiple
authentication providers are in use.

  A regression introduced in 2.14.7 allowed a user's account to be taken
  over by creating an account on a different provider with exactly the same
  username as the existing Gerrit account.

* [Issue 10082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10082):
Decouple online reindex activation from index module.

  Plugins were not loaded before online indexing was triggered, resulting
  in plugin-contributed submit rules not being evaluated during indexing.

  Online reindex activation is now decoupled from the index module and
  thus postpones the triggering of online reindexing until after loading
  of the plugins.

* Evict group caches on group creation.

  If a group was created after a previous cache miss for its name, Id,
  or UUID, the cache also did not return the group if it is called
  immediately after the group was created.

* [Issue 10240](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10240):
Fix internal server error when cloning a repository from Gerrit slave.

* Improve error handling if comment note is too large during schema migration.

  During migration to schema 169, comments in NoteDb are migrated to json.
  If loading the blob for a comment note failed due to being too large (in
  excess of a hard-coded 25MB limit), the migration would fail.

  The hard-coded limit is now removed. It is still possible that the migration
  can fail if the blob is excessively large, but the logging of such a
  failure is improved so that the change that failed can be tracked down.

* [Issue 4278](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4278):
Fix wrong code snippet in email notifications.

* Upgrade jackson-core to 2.9.8.

  [Version 2.9.8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.8)
  includes several bug fixes, including security fixes.

* Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 6.5.4.

* [Issue 10263](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10263):
Include edit ref in `EditInfo` element returned by the edit API.

  It was not possible for users of the Java API to get the edit ref.

* Export the project indexer in the plugin API.

* [Issue 10260](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10260):
Replication plugin: Fix auto-replay of stored events during config reload.

* Add a new method on the account API to set the account name.

* Add new methods on the project API to get/set the project's `HEAD`.

#### PolyGerrit

* [Issue 9410](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9410):
Add the GWT hash separator to the GWT url.

* Merge top menu items contributed by plugins.

  Each plugin contributes a list single of menus, which are expected
  to be merged in existing top menu entries if they already exist. This
  was implemented in the GWT UI, but not in PolyGerrit.

* [Issue 10267](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10267):
Add support for several more MIME types in syntax highlighting.

  Support is added for: powershell, xquery, cmake, coffeescript, crystal, diff,
  django, dockerfile, ebnf, elm, erlang, fortran, groovy, haml, haxe, ini, julia,
  latex, less, mathematica, nginx, nsis, postgresql, q, scss, scheme, excel, tcl,
  twig, vb, vbscript.

* [Issue 10137](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10137):
Fix alignment of the "By User" column on the group audit screen.

### 2.16.2

* __SECURITY__ [Issue 10201](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10201):
Remove support for Git protocol v2, because of a security vulnerability discovered

  The JGit implementation of protocol V2 does not invoke the
  advertiseRefsHook on fetch and ls-refs, which results in all
  refs being sent, regardless of the configured ACLs.

* [Issue 9024](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9024):
Fix setting `PRIVATE` and `WIP` for updated changes in console report.

  In some cases the private and work-in-progress status indicator for
  changes updated by push was shown incorrectly.

* [Issue 10564](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10564):
Fix case-insensitive searching of hashtags.

  The index field has always been stored lowercase, since we intended
  hashtag searches to be case-insensitive. However, we never converted the
  input string to lower case, with the unexpected result that searching
  for `hashtag:ACamelCaseTag` would not return results for changes who
  contain that exact hashtag.

* [Issue 10112](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10112):
Upgrade rules_closure to make Gerrit buildable with the latest Bazel version.

* [Issue 9781](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9781):
Fix full ACL evaluation for LDAP groups.

  The LDAP groups have been historically filtered by relevance to
  the Gerrit ACLs. However, that optimization has the side effect
  of blocking users to access legitimate projects if they are
  temporarily not cached in memory.
  Allow to disable the LDAP filtering optimization for having always
  a 100% consistent ACL evaluation, regardless of the project's cache
  status.

* Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 6.5.3.

* Discontinue support for Elasticsearch 2.4.

* Add preliminary support for Elasticsearch 7.

  Support for Elasticsearch 7 is added, and tested against the `alpha1`
  release.

* Add a new method on the account API to set the account name.

### 2.16.1

* [Issue 10018](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10018):
Fix failure to upgrade schema when migrating from 2.13.

* [Issue 10038](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10038):
Add support for Elasticsearch 6.5.

* [Issue 10052](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10052):
Fix invalid requests to Elasticsearch.

* [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021):
Security - Disallow create project to execute arbitrary code on the client
by quoting and encoding project names.

* Fix incorrect json in the example for the 'Set Access' REST endpoint.

* [Issue 10143](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10143):
Fix internal server error when running the `kill` command.

* [Issue 9768](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9768):
Explicitly set the number of shards and replicas for Elasticsearch, and
allow them to be configured.

  From Elasticsearch version 7 the default number of shards per node
  will be changed from 5 to 1.

  The number of shards and number of replicas are now explicitly set when
  creating the index.

  The new settings `elasticsearch.numberOfShards` and `elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas`
  allow the values to be configured. The default values are 5 and 1,
  respectively, which is the same as the default values used by Elasticsearch
  prior to version 7.

* Discontinue support for Elasticsearch 2.4.

* Add preliminary support for Elasticsearch 7.

  Support for Elasticsearch 7 is added, and tested against the `alpha1`
  release.

* Fix internal server error when listing reviewers of a change with reviewers by email.

  Reviewers by email don't have an account ID but formatting reviewers as
  JSON tried to get account IDs of all reviewers. This failed when the
  change had any reviewers by email.

* Do not create index on `account_group_members` table in postgres database.

  The `account_group_members` table was deleted, but the postgres
  setup still tried to create an index on it, which prevented a new
  site from starting up.

* Don't serve PolyGerrit UI when running in headless mode.

* Don't serve static resources when running in slave mode.

* Fix assignee's status on the change screen.

  The assignee field's status showed the change owner's status text.

* Add missing documentation of the 'Read As' capability.

#### Breaking changes

* [Change-Id: I3752456](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/205682) Use dynamic binding for `UrlFormatter`.

  The `UrlFormatter` interface had a fixed binding to its default
  implementation, which meant it was not possible for plugins to
  provide a different implementation but were merely injecting it
  when needed

  It is now possible to replace the default implementation using
  a DynamicItem<UrlFormatter> which requires a change in how it is
  injected and used in plugins.
