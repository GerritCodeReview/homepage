## Important Notes

### Known problem with schema upgrade

When a gerrit site older than 2.15 is migrated to 2.16, then schema
migration should be first performed to the latest 2.15.x release.

To upgrade to the latest 2.15.x release:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit-2.15.latest.war init -d ${site_path}
```

### Known problem with plugins and index

Since 2.14.2 the plugins are loaded before online reindexing is started, so
that prolog rules provided by plugins can be invoked during indexing. See
[issue 6472](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6472) for
details.

This causes a problem for any plugins that access the index either directly
or indirectly (i.e. by accessing a cache), because the index is not yet
available when the plugin is loaded during server startup. An example of this
is in the replication plugin, which needs to use the group cache when
`authGroup` is used in a destination configuration.

A fix [issue 10082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10082)
is available since 2.16.3 release.

### Migration to NoteDb

[NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html)
is now required for accounts (since 2.15) and groups (since 2.16), and is the preferred storage for changes.

In Gerrit 2.15:
* Account data (with the exception of Group data) was moved to NoteDB ([release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2.15.html#notedb-for-accounts)).
* Change data could be either moved to NoteDB ([migration process](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/note-db.html#migration)), or left in ReviewDB.

In Gerrit 2.16:
* Group data is always moved to NoteDB (it is migrated automatically during the upgrade process, when you run `gerrit.war init`).

When upgrading to Gerrit v2.16, you are strongly advised to migrate fully (including changes) from ReviewDb to NoteDb.

You should review the documentation on [NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html),
including the information about the migration process:

- [On-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#online-migration)
- [Off-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#offline-migration)

Although ReviewDb is still technically available on Gerrit v2.16, the upgrade to NoteDb is strongly recommended, although not enforced.

Note that in the next version of Gerrit (v3.0), ReviewDb will not be available.

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d ${site_path}
```

### Reindex for new projects index and changed group index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d ${site_path}
```

The group index gained two new fields, which Gerrit 2.16 depends on. For this
reason, the following command to offline reindex the group index must be
executed as well:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index groups -d ${site_path}
```

The offline reindex for groups should also be run on Gerrit slave hosts.

Note that if you are migrating from v2.15, it is not necessary to reindex the changes and accounts indexes
offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer after
starting Gerrit.

### Support for GWT UI is deprecated

From 2.16 GWT UI is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

### Support for Velocity templates removed

In [version 2.14](2.14.md) support for Soy templates was added. For backwards
compatibility, support for Velocity templates (VTL) was kept.

In version 2.16 support for VTL is completely removed. Site administrators must
replace any Velocity templates (`.vm` files in `$site/etc/mail/`) with the equivalent
Soy templates before upgrading to this version.

### Push to refs/changes is deprecated

The possibility to push to `refs/changes` is now disabled by default.  It is
still possible to enable it in the gerrit config by setting
[receive.allowPushToRefsChanges](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-gerrit.html#receive.allowPushToRefsChanges)
to true.

### DELETE requests with bodies are no longer recommended

Some proxies, which are not under client control, prohibit DELETE requests with
bodies. DELETE requests with bodies could work on a first attempt, but could
fail afterwards because a server they have no control over was updated. In this
case, client users could be in trouble if they were not notified.

Therefore, we have decided to no longer recommend sending DELETE requests with
bodies. They will continue to work in this release but should be considered as
deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Pegdown is replaced by Flexmark

[flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) is a Java implementation of
CommonMark 0.28 spec parser using the blocks first, inlines after Markdown parsing
architecture.

Its strengths are speed, flexibility, Markdown source element based AST with details
of the source position down to individual characters of lexemes that make up the
element and extensibility, compared to Pegdown speed that was, in general, less than
ideal and for pathological input either hangs or practically hangs during parsing.

### SYSTEM_CONFIG table is removed

This table was used to retrieve the `site_path` directory in unattended setup
mode. As a replacement, system property `gerrit.site_path` should be used.

### Git clients older than 2.x are not supported anymore

The Gerrit hook script for adding the Change-Id in every local commit has been
simplified and is now using the git-interpret-trailers command.
The interpret trailers command is available as of git v2.2.0, released
Dec 2014.

Existing cloned repositories that have been cloned before the migration to v2.16
and thus having the old hook for generating the Change-Id will continue to work.
However, new clones and hook scripts will need to upgrade your local git client
to v2.2.0 or later.

If you have existing older git clients and cannot migrate to v2.2.0 or later, you need
to keep serving the old script, copying it to the Gerrit /static directory, and
then amend the Gerrit helper instructions to download it.

Example (assuming Gerrit installed on $GERRIT_SITE and available at https://gerrit.mycompany.com):

```
$ curl 'https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.15/gerrit-server/src/main/resources/com/google/gerrit/server/tools/root/hooks/commit-msg?format=TEXT' > $GERRIT_SITE/static/commit-msg
$ git config -f $GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config gerrit.installCommitMsgHookCommand 'gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); curl -o ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg https://gerrit.mycompany.com/static/commit-msg ; chmod +x ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg'
```

## New Features

### 'Read As' capability

The new ['Read As' capability](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.3/access-control.html#capability_readAs)
allows users to impersonate any user to see which refs they can see.

Note: the capability was added in 2.16 but only documented since 2.16.1.

### PolyGerrit enhancements

#### Inline edit
- [Issue 4437](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4437)
  inline edit is fully implemented using the CodeMirror Editor plugin.

  A new core plugin, `codemirror-editor`, is available,
  which uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) to provide a rich code editing
  experience in PolyGerrit.

  When you upgrade Gerrit using `init -d`, you are given the option to install the
  `codemirror-editor` plugin.

### New logging framework

For logging Gerrit is now using [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger)
instead of SLF4J. The logging backend is still LOG4J.

The Flogger LOG4J backend is configured by a system property
(`flogger.backend_factory=com.google.common.flogger.backend.log4j.Log4jBackendFactory#getInstance`)
that must be set for logging to work. There is an init step that automatically
sets this system property in the `gerrit.config` file and in addition Gerrit
tries to set this system property automatically on startup if it isn't set yet.
However for some setups you may need to do additional actions to make sure that
this system property is set.

In addition there is a system property that needs to be set for
[request tracing](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html)
(`flogger.logging_context=com.google.gerrit.server.logging.LoggingContext#getInstance`).
Also this system property is automatically set in the `gerrit.config` file by an
init step and in addition Gerrit tries to set this system property automatically
on startup if it isn't set yet. However for some setups you may need to do
additional actions to make sure that this system property is set.

SLF4J can still be used by plugins, but using SLF4J in plugins is deprecated and
with the next Gerrit release SLF4J will no longer be exported as part of the
Gerrit plugin API jar. This means from the next release onwards, plugins must either
migrate to Flogger or have an own dependency on SLF4J.


### REST API

There are several new REST endpoints and additions to existing endpoints, as described in the [REST API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api.html) documentation.

See below an overview of the noteworthy changes.

#### [Access Rights Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html)

* [`ProjectAccessInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html#project-access-info)
  has a new field `configWebLinks` containing a list of URLs that display the history
  of the configuration file governing this project’s access rights.

#### [Accounts Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html)

* [Query accounts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#query-account)
  requires the [Modify Account](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
  permission to return the all the emails associated with the account.

* New endpoint [`/drafts.delete`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#_delete_draft_comments)

  [get](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#get-change-message)
  and [delete](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#delete-change-message)
  the messages `/messages` of a change including the detailed
  account information associated.

* New endpoint [`/cherrypick`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#cherry-pick)
  to cherry-pick a specific commit.

#### [Config Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html)

* New endpoint [`/server/reload`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#reload-config)
  to reload Gerrit configuration.

* New endpoint [`/server/preferences.edit`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#get-edit-preferences)
  to retrieve and update the global edit preferences for the server.

#### [Groups Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html)

* New option [`?ownedBy`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html#_find_groups_that_are_owned_by_another_group)
  to find groups that are owned by another group

#### [Project Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html)

* New option `?state` to get [all projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#suggest-projects)
  with the given state.

* New option [`?query`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#query-projects)
  for querying projects limited to a maximum of `?limit` entries.

* New endpoint `/description` for [updating](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#set-project-description)
  and [deleting](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#delete-project-description) the project's description.

* [Check project access](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access)
  endpoint is now a GET API while the [POST is still supported by deprecated](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access-post).

* New endpoint to index a project [`/index`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index)
  and all the changes [`/index.changes`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index.changes)
  associated to it.

* New endpoint [`/check`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check)
  to check project's consistency.

#### [Commit Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#commit-endpoints)

* New endpoint [`/files`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#list-files)
  to list files associated with a commit.

### Request Tracing

If a request is traced the unique trace ID is attached to all logs that are triggered
by the request. In addition all logs are enforced regardless of the configured log level.
Given the trace ID an administrator can find the trace in the error log and debug issues more
easily.

Detailed information about request tracing can be found in the
[request tracing documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html).

### New configuration option to ignore self approval on labels

A new option for Review Labels,
[label.Label-Name.ignoreSelfApproval](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-labels.html#label_ignoreSelfApproval),
is available.

If true, the label may be voted on by the uploader of the latest patch set, but their approval does not make a change submittable. Instead, a non-uploader who has the right to vote has to approve the change.

It defaults to `false`, but one possible use case is to set the value to `true` for the `Code-Review` label in the `All-Projects` project.
That value will then be inherited by all projects that do not override the `Code-Review` label settings.

* [Issue 10380](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10380):
  Use project index to render change list on GWT UI.

  __NOTE__: As a consequence of this change, the [list projects REST-API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/rest-api-projects.html#list-projects)
  and project list screen on GWT UI will be subject to the same [queryLimit capability settings](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/access-control.html#capability_queryLimit)
  as in the PolyGerrit UI. The same limit applies to the [gerrit ls-projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.5/cmd-ls-projects.html) command.

* [Issue 10382](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10382)
  DefaultMemoryCacheModule/DefaultMemoryCacheFactory are not exported anymore the plugin API

* [Issue 10401](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10401):
  Reimplement the project children API on top of the projects secondary index, which requires
  a significant less amount heap and CPU.

#### Other fixes

* Improve error messages emitted from commit validators.

* Add support for Elasticsearch 6.6.

### 2.16.4

#### Reindex for projects, accounts and groups indexes.

Gerrit 2.16.4 includes a fix to the projects, accounts, and groups secondary indexes.
It is very unusual for Gerrit to require a reindex inside a point release.
However, this is an exception because it is the only solution to fix the list sorting
[Issue 10210](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10210) reported on PolyGerrit.

The reindex of projects, accounts and groups can be performed either offline or online.
For the offline reindex, make sure that Gerrit is not active and run the following commands:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d ${site_path}
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index groups   -d ${site_path}
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index accounts -d ${site_path}
```

The online reindex does not require any commands: upgrade the gerrit.war
and restart Gerrit.

**NOTE**: The online reindex for projects may take quite a long time and
require a substantial amount of heap memory to run. During the reindex operation,
Gerrit performance may be sluggish and, even after the reindex is complete,
it would take quite some time for the memory to be released.
It is thus recommended to perform the offline reindex, to avoid impacting the
server performance at startup and after the reindex is complete.

#### Fixes

##### PolyGerrit

* [Issue 8740](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8740):
  Disable deps.js requests in the index template to fix page load delay.

* [Issue 10371](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10371):
  Fix an issue where a saved edit would always restore the same content
  in subsequent edits of the same file, due to the cache not being erased.

* [Issue 9909](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9909):
  Do not crash PolyGerrit UI if permitted labels array is empty

* [Issue 10324](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10324):
  Allow plugins (e.g. delete-project) to control the cache invalidation
  and display new content immediately without refreshing the page.

* Fix broken links in gr-icons.html.

* [Issue 7669](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7669),
  [Issue 9614](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9614):
  Fix '/' getting typed in search bar when pressed.

* [Issue 10151](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10151):
  [Issue 10019](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10019):
  Fix the "delete" button visibility to allow branch deletion.

* [Issue 10317](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10317):
  Don't show "Same Topic" for only one change.

  When there is only one change in the topic, it doesn't add any value
  to show the "Same Topic" tab/section because it will always only include
  the currently viewed change.

  The query used to get the changes is modified to exclude the current
  change. This means that the "Same Topic" tab/section now only shows other
  changes in the same topic, but never the current change.

#### Other fixes
* [Issue 10326](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10326):
Fix excessive heap and CPU usage when listing projects.

* Create the `.git/hooks` folder in download commands.

* Add method to get related changes in the Changes API.

* Add method to get edit details in the Change Edit API.

  The new method allows to set the base revision, and request to include the
  files and download commands.

* Add `--skip-project` option to the `MigrateToNoteDb` command.

  This is useful when only a few projects should be skipped but all others
  should be migrated.

### 2.16.3

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262):
Upgrade JGit to 5.1.5.201812261915-r to fix validation of `wants` in
`git-upload-pack` for protocol v0 stateless transports.

  AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for `git-upload-pack` in protocol v0
  stateless transports, meaning that `wants` were not validated and
  a user could fetch anything that is pointed to by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1),
  as long as they could guess the object name.

* [Issue 10242](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10242):
Fix regression that allows a user's account to be taken over when multiple
authentication providers are in use.

  A regression introduced in 2.14.7 allowed a user's account to be taken
  over by creating an account on a different provider with exactly the same
  username as the existing Gerrit account.

* [Issue 10082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10082):
Decouple online reindex activation from index module.

  Plugins were not loaded before online indexing was triggered, resulting
  in plugin-contributed submit rules not being evaluated during indexing.

  Online reindex activation is now decoupled from the index module and
  thus postpones the triggering of online reindexing until after loading
  of the plugins.

* Evict group caches on group creation.

  If a group was created after a previous cache miss for its name, Id,
  or UUID, the cache also did not return the group if it is called
  immediately after the group was created.

* [Issue 10240](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10240):
Fix internal server error when cloning a repository from Gerrit slave.

* Improve error handling if comment note is too large during schema migration.

  During migration to schema 169, comments in NoteDb are migrated to json.
  If loading the blob for a comment note failed due to being too large (in
  excess of a hard-coded 25MB limit), the migration would fail.

  The hard-coded limit is now removed. It is still possible that the migration
  can fail if the blob is excessively large, but the logging of such a
  failure is improved so that the change that failed can be tracked down.

* [Issue 4278](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4278):
Fix wrong code snippet in email notifications.

* Upgrade jackson-core to 2.9.8.

  [Version 2.9.8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.8)
  includes several bug fixes, including security fixes.

* Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 6.5.4.

* [Issue 10263](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10263):
Include edit ref in `EditInfo` element returned by the edit API.

  It was not possible for users of the Java API to get the edit ref.

* Export the project indexer in the plugin API.

* [Issue 10260](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10260):
Replication plugin: Fix auto-replay of stored events during config reload.

* Add a new method on the account API to set the account name.

* Add new methods on the project API to get/set the project's `HEAD`.

* Add a new method on the commit API to get "included in" information.

#### PolyGerrit

* [Issue 9410](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9410):
Add the GWT hash separator to the GWT url.

* Merge top menu items contributed by plugins.

  Each plugin contributes a list single of menus, which are expected
  to be merged in existing top menu entries if they already exist. This
  was implemented in the GWT UI, but not in PolyGerrit.

* [Issue 10267](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10267):
Add support for several more MIME types in syntax highlighting.

  Support is added for: powershell, xquery, cmake, coffeescript, crystal, diff,
  django, dockerfile, ebnf, elm, erlang, fortran, groovy, haml, haxe, ini, julia,
  latex, less, mathematica, nginx, nsis, postgresql, q, scss, scheme, excel, tcl,
  twig, vb, vbscript.

* [Issue 10137](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10137):
Fix alignment of the "By User" column on the group audit screen.

### 2.16.2

* __SECURITY__ [Issue 10201](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10201):
Remove support for Git protocol v2, because of a security vulnerability discovered

  The JGit implementation of protocol V2 does not invoke the
  advertiseRefsHook on fetch and ls-refs, which results in all
  refs being sent, regardless of the configured ACLs.

* [Issue 9024](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9024):
Fix setting `PRIVATE` and `WIP` for updated changes in console report.

  In some cases the private and work-in-progress status indicator for
  changes updated by push was shown incorrectly.

* Fix case-insensitive searching of hashtags.

* [Issue 10106](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10106):
Fix incorrect json in the example for the 'Set Access' REST endpoint.

* [Issue 10112](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10112):
Upgrade rules_closure to make Gerrit buildable with the latest Bazel version.

* [Issue 9781](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9781):
Fix full ACL evaluation for LDAP groups.

  The LDAP groups have been historically filtered by relevance to
  the Gerrit ACLs. However, that optimization has the side effect
  of blocking users to access legitimate projects if they are
  temporarily not cached in memory.
  Allow to disable the LDAP filtering optimization for having always
  a 100% consistent ACL evaluation, regardless of the project's cache
  status.

* Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 6.5.3.

* Discontinue support for Elasticsearch 2.4.

* Add preliminary support for Elasticsearch 7.

  Support for Elasticsearch 7 is added, and tested against the `alpha1`
  release.


* Add a new method on the account API to set the account name.

### 2.16.1

* [Issue 10018](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10018):
Fix failure to upgrade schema when migrating from 2.13.

* [Issue 10038](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10038):
Add support for Elasticsearch 6.5.

* [Issue 10052](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10052):
Fix invalid requests to Elasticsearch.

* [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021):
Security - Disallow create project to execute arbitrary code on the client
by quoting and encoding project names.

* [Issue 10106](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10106):
Documentaiton - REST API for updating project rights amended with correct payload.

* [Issue 10143](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10143):
Fix internal server error when running the `kill` command.

* [Issue 9768](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9768):
Explicitly set the number of shards and replicas for Elasticsearch, and
allow them to be configured.

  From Elasticsearch version 7 the default number of shards per node
  will be changed from 5 to 1.

  The number of shards and number of replicas are now explicitly set when
  creating the index.

  The new settings `elasticsearch.numberOfShards` and `elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas`
  allow the values to be configured. The default values are 5 and 1,
  respectively, which is the same as the default values used by Elasticsearch
  prior to version 7.

* Discontinue support for Elasticsearch 2.4.

* Add preliminary support for Elasticsearch 7.

  Support for Elasticsearch 7 is added, and tested against the `alpha1`
  release.

* Fix internal server error when listing reviewers of a change with reviewers by email.

  Reviewers by email don't have an account ID but formatting reviewers as
  JSON tried to get account IDs of all reviewers. This failed when the
  change had any reviewers by email.

* Do not create index on `account_group_members` table in postgres database.

  The `account_group_members` table was deleted, but the postgres
  setup still tried to create an index on it, which prevented a new
  site from starting up.

* Don't serve PolyGerrit UI when running in headless mode.

* Don't serve static resources when running in slave mode.

* Fix assignee's status on the change screen.

  The assignee field's status showed the change owner's status text.

* Add missing documentation of the 'Read As' capability.

#### Breaking changes

* [Change-Id: I3752456](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/205682) Use dynamic binding for `UrlFormatter`.

  The `UrlFormatter` interface had a fixed binding to its default
  implementation, which meant it was not possible for plugins to
  provide a different implementation but were merely injecting it
  when needed

  It is now possible to replace the default implementation using
  a DynamicItem<UrlFormatter> which requires a change in how it is
  injected and used in plugins.
