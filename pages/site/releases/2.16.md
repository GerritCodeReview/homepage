## Release Highlights

* Support for git [protocol version 2](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html).

* GWT UI is deprecated, and PolyGerrit is now the default UI.

* Experimental Dark Mode in PolyGerrit.

* Inline editing support in PolyGerrit UI.

* Redesigned UI for PolyGerrit based on material design.

* New configuration option to ignore self-approval on labels.

* New CommonMark/Markdown parser.

## Important Notes

[NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html)
is now required for accounts (since 2.15) and groups (since 2.16), and is the preferred storage for changes.

When upgrading to Gerrit v2.16, you are strongly advised to migrate fully (including changes) from ReviewDb to NoteDb.

Although ReviewDb is still technically available on Gerrit v2.16, the upgrade to NoteDb is strongly recommended, although not enforced.

Note that in the next version of Gerrit (v3.0), ReviewDb will not be available.

Drop support for git clients older than 2.2.x.

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d ${site_path}
```

### Reindex for new projects index and changed group index

Gerrit 2.16 introduces a new secondary index for projects. The initial version
of this index must be created by running the offline reindex before starting
Gerrit:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index projects -d ${site_path}
```

The group index gained two new fields, which Gerrit 2.16 depends on. For this
reason, the following command to offline reindex the group index must be
executed as well:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index groups -d ${site_path}
```

The offline reindex for groups should also be run on Gerrit slave hosts.

Note that if you are migrating from v2.15, it is not necessary to reindex the changes and accounts indexes
offline. These will automatically be reindexed by the online reindexer after
starting Gerrit.

### Migration to NoteDb

You should review the documentation on [NoteDb](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/note-db.html),
including the information about the migration process:

- [On-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#online-migration)
- [Off-line migration](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html#offline-migration)

In Gerrit 2.15:
* Account data (with the exception of Group data) was moved to NoteDB ([release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/2.15.html#notedb-for-accounts)).
* Change data could be either moved to NoteDB ([migration process](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.15/note-db.html#migration)), or left in ReviewDB.

In Gerrit 2.16:
* Group data is always moved to NoteDB (it is migrated automatically during the upgrade process, when you run `gerrit.war init`).


### Support for GWT UI is deprecated

From 2.16 GWT UI is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

### Support for Velocity templates removed

In [version 2.14](2.14.md) support for Soy templates was added. For backwards
compatibility, support for Velocity templates (VTL) was kept.

In version 2.16 support for VTL is completely removed. Site administrators must
replace any Velocity templates (`.vm` files in `$site/etc/mail/`) with the equivalent
Soy templates before upgrading to this version.

### Push to refs/changes is deprecated

The possibility to push to `refs/changes` is now disabled by default.  It is
still possible to enable it in the gerrit config by setting
[receive.allowPushToRefsChanges](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-gerrit.html#receive.allowPushToRefsChanges)
to true.

### DELETE requests with bodies are no longer recommended

Some proxies, which are not under client control, prohibit DELETE requests with
bodies. DELETE requests with bodies could work on a first attempt, but could
fail afterwards because a server they have no control over was updated. In this
case, client users could be in trouble if they were not notified.

Therefore, we have decided to no longer recommend sending DELETE requests with
bodies. They will continue to work in this release but should be considered as
deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

### Pegdown is replaced by Flexmark

[flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) is a Java implementation of
CommonMark 0.28 spec parser using the blocks first, inlines after Markdown parsing
architecture.

Its strengths are speed, flexibility, Markdown source element based AST with details
of the source position down to individual characters of lexemes that make up the
element and extensibility, compared to Pegdown speed that was, in general, less than
ideal and for pathological input either hangs or practically hangs during parsing.

### SYSTEM_CONFIG table is removed

This table was used to retrieve the `site_path` directory in unattended setup
mode. As a replacement, system property `gerrit.site_path` should be used.

### Git clients older than 2.x are not supported anymore

The Gerrit hook script for adding the Change-Id in every local commit has been
simplified and is now using the git-interpret-trailers command.
The interpret trailers command is available as of git v2.2.0, released
Dec 2014.

Existing cloned repositories that have been cloned before the migration to v2.16
and thus having the old hook for generating the Change-Id will continue to work.
However, new clones and hook scripts will need to upgrade your local git client
to v2.2.0 or later.

If you have existing older git clients and cannot migrate to v2.2.0 or later, you need
to keep serving the old script, copying it to the Gerrit /static directory, and
then amend the Gerrit helper instructions to download it.

Example (assuming Gerrit installed on $GERRIT_SITE and available at https://gerrit.mycompany.com):

```
$ curl 'https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/stable-2.15/gerrit-server/src/main/resources/com/google/gerrit/server/tools/root/hooks/commit-msg?format=TEXT' > $GERRIT_SITE/static/commit-msg
$ git config -f $GERRIT_SITE/etc/gerrit.config gerrit.installCommitMsgHookCommand 'gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); curl -o ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg https://gerrit.mycompany.com/static/commit-msg ; chmod +x ${gitdir}/hooks/commit-msg'
```

## New Features

### Git protocol version 2

Support for upload pack with git protocol version 2 can be enabled by
setting `receive.enableProtocolV2` in `gerrit.config` and adding the
configuration:

```
[protocol]
  version = 2
```

either in the gerrit user's `~/.gitconfig` to enable for all repositories,
or on a per repository basis in each repository's `config` file on the
server.

On the client side, the same `protocol.version` must be set either in
the user's `~/.gitconfig` or in the repository's `.git/config` file.

### 'Read As' capability

The new ['Read As' capability](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.1/access-control.html#capability_readAs)
allows users to impersonate any user to see which refs they can see.

Note: the capability was added in 2.16 but only documented since 2.16.1.

### New logging framework

For logging Gerrit is now using [Flogger](https://github.com/google/flogger)
instead of SLF4J. The logging backend is still LOG4J.

The Flogger LOG4J backend is configured by a system property
(`flogger.backend_factory=com.google.common.flogger.backend.log4j.Log4jBackendFactory#getInstance`)
that must be set for logging to work. There is an init step that automatically
sets this system property in the `gerrit.config` file and in addition Gerrit
tries to set this system property automatically on startup if it isn't set yet.
However for some setups you may need to do additional actions to make sure that
this system property is set.

In addition there is a system property that needs to be set for
[request tracing](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html)
(`flogger.logging_context=com.google.gerrit.server.logging.LoggingContext#getInstance`).
Also this system property is automatically set in the `gerrit.config` file by an
init step and in addition Gerrit tries to set this system property automatically
on startup if it isn't set yet. However for some setups you may need to do
additional actions to make sure that this system property is set.

SLF4J can still be used by plugins, but using SLF4J in plugins is deprecated and
with the next Gerrit release SLF4J will no longer be exported as part of the
Gerrit plugin API jar. This means from the next release onwards, plugins must either
migrate to Flogger or have an own dependency on SLF4J.


### REST API

There are several new REST endpoints and additions to existing endpoints, as described in the [REST API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api.html) documentation.

See below an overview of the noteworthy changes.

#### [Access Rights Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html)

* [`ProjectAccessInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-access.html#project-access-info)
  has a new field `configWebLinks` containing a list of URLs that display the history
  of the configuration file governing this project’s access rights.

#### [Accounts Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html)

* [Query accounts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#query-account)
  requires the [Modify Account](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/access-control.html#capability_modifyAccount)
  permission to return the all the emails associated with the account.

* New endpoint [`/drafts.delete`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-accounts.html#_delete_draft_comments)
  to remove the drafts comments associated with an account.

#### [Changes Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html)

* New endpoints to [lists](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#list-change-messages),
  [get](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#get-change-message)
  and [delete](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#delete-change-message)
  the messages `/messages` of a change including the detailed
  account information associated.

* New endpoint [`/cherrypick`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-changes.html#cherry-pick)
  to cherry-pick a specific commit.

#### [Config Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html)

* New endpoint [`/server/reload`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#reload-config)
  to reload Gerrit configuration.

* New endpoint [`/server/preferences.edit`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-config.html#get-edit-preferences)
  to retrieve and update the global edit preferences for the server.

#### [Groups Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html)

* New option [`?ownedBy`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-groups.html#_find_groups_that_are_owned_by_another_group)
  to find groups that are owned by another group

#### [Project Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html)

* New option `?state` to get [all projects](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#suggest-projects)
  with the given state.

* New option [`?query`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#query-projects)
  for querying projects limited to a maximum of `?limit` entries.

* New endpoint `/description` for [updating](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#set-project-description)
  and [deleting](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#delete-project-description) the project's description.

* [Check project access](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access)
  endpoint is now a GET API while the [POST is still supported by deprecated](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check-access-post).

* New endpoint to index a project [`/index`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index)
  and all the changes [`/index.changes`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#index.changes)
  associated to it.

* New endpoint [`/check`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#check)
  to check project's consistency.

#### [Commit Endpoints](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#commit-endpoints)

* New endpoint [`/files`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api-projects.html#list-files)
  to list files associated with a commit.

### [Request Tracing](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/rest-api.html#tracing)

For each REST endpoint tracing can be enabled by setting the `trace=<trace-id>` request parameter.
Given the trace ID an administrator can find the corresponding logs and investigate issues more easily.

### New configuration option to ignore self approval on labels

A new option for Review Labels,
[label.Label-Name.ignoreSelfApproval](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/config-labels.html#label_ignoreSelfApproval),
is available.

If true, the label may be voted on by the uploader of the latest patch set, but their approval does not make a change submittable. Instead, a non-uploader who has the right to vote has to approve the change.

It defaults to `false`, but one possible use case is to set the value to `true` for the `Code-Review` label in the `All-Projects` project.
That value will then be inherited by all projects that do not override the `Code-Review` label settings.

### CodeMirror plugin for PolyGerrit

A new core plugin, `codemirror-editor`, is available,
which uses [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) to provide a rich code editing experience in PolyGerrit.

When you upgrade Gerrit using `init -d`, you are given the option to install the `codemirror-editor` plugin.

### Request Tracing

Tracing can now be enabled for single requests. If a request is traced a unique
trace ID is attached to all logs that are triggered by the request. In addition
all logs are enforced regardless of the configured log level. Given the trace ID
an administrator can find the trace in the error log and debug issues more
easily. Detailed information about request tracing can be found in the
[request tracing documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16/user-request-tracing.html).

## Bugfix Releases

### 2.16.1

* [Issue 10018](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10018):
Fix failure to upgrade schema when migrating from 2.13.

* [Issue 10038](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10038):
Add support for Elasticsearch 6.5.1.

* [Issue 10052](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10052):
Fix invalid requests to Elasticsearch.

* [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021):
Quote and encode project names in download commands.

* [Issue 10143](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10143):
Fix internal server error when running the `kill` command.

* [Issue 9768](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9768):
Explicitly set the number of shards and replicas for Elasticsearch, and
allow them to be configured.

  From Elasticsearch version 7 the default number of shards per node
  will be changed from 5 to 1.

  The number of shards and number of replicas are now explicitly set when
  creating the index.

  The new settings `elasticsearch.numberOfShards` and `elasticsearch.numberOfReplicas`
  allow the values to be configured. The default values are 5 and 1,
  respectively, which is the same as the default values used by Elasticsearch
  prior to version 7.

* Discontinue support for Elasticsearch 2.4.

* Add preliminary support for Elasticsearch 7.

  Support for Elasticsearch 7 is added, and tested against the `alpha1`
  release.

* Fix internal server error when listing reviewers of a change with reviewers by email.

  Reviewers by email don't have an account ID but formatting reviewers as
  JSON tried to get account IDs of all reviewers. This failed when the
  change had any reviewers by email.

* Use dynamic binding for `UrlFormatter`.

  The `UrlFormatter` interface had a fixed binding to its default
  implementation, which meant it was not possible for plugins to
  provide a different implementation as intended.

* Do not create index on `account_group_members` table in postgres database.

  The `account_group_members` table was deleted, but the postgres
  setup still tried to create an index on it, which prevented a new
  site from starting up.

* Don't serve Polygerrit UI when running in headless mode.

* Don't serve static resources when running in slave mode.

* Fix assignee's status on the change screen.

  The assignee field's status showed the change owner's status text.

* Add missing documentation of the 'Read As' capability.
