## Release Highlights

* Removal of GWT UI

  The GWT UI is removed and PolyGerrit is now the only UI.

* Removal of ReviewDb

  The database backend for changes, accounts, groups and projects ("ReviewDb") is
  removed and all metadata is now stored in git ("NoteDb").

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Breaking Changes

* Reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default

  The `gerrit.disableReverseDnsLookup` option with default value false is replaced
  by `gerrit.enableReverseDnsLookp` also with default value false. This means that
  reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default.
