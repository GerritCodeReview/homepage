## Release Highlights

* Removal of GWT UI

  The GWT UI is removed and PolyGerrit is now the only UI.

* Removal of ReviewDb

  The database backend for changes, accounts, groups and projects ("ReviewDb") is
  removed and this metadata is now stored in git ("NoteDb").

  A database is still needed for account patch reviews, which stores the 'reviewed'
  flag for files in a review per user. The default backend is H2, but MySQL,
  PostgreSQL and MariaDb are also supported. See the
  [documentation](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/config-gerrit.html#accountPatchReviewDb)
  for details.

  It is also possible for plugins to provide another backend by implementing the
  [`AccountPatchReviewStore`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#account-patch-review-store)
  interface.

* New quota enforcer extension point.

* [Issue 4040](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4040):
Support for signed push with GPG subkeys.

* New core plugins: `delete-project`, `gitiles`, `plugin-manager`, and `webhooks`.

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Breaking Changes

* Reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default

  The `gerrit.disableReverseDnsLookup` option with default value false is replaced
  by `gerrit.enableReverseDnsLookp` also with default value false. This means that
  reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default.

## New Features

* New quota enforcer extension point.

  Plugins may implement the
  [QuotaEnforcer](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#quota-enforcer)
  interface to enforce
  [quotas](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#quota-enforcer).

* [Issue 4040](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4040):
Support for signed push with GPG subkeys.

  It is now possible to use a GPG subkey when pusing commits with signed push.

* [Issue 6053](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6053):
Support for searching on mobile devices.

* [Issue 8535](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8535):
Support for plugin config entries in the PolyGerrit UI.

  Configuration entries defined by server-side plugins are now displayed
  in the UI.

* New method to get UI top menus in the config API.

* New core plugins.

  The `delete-project`, `gitiles`, `plugin-manager`, and `webhooks` plugins are
  now core plugins bundled with the release, and can be installed during site
  initialization.

* RPM/Deb: Remove Gerrit service start upon package setup.

  Gerrit service is no longer started automatically after the package installation,
  but requires manual invocation of the `/etc/init.d/gerrit start` command, or
  the configuration of the service for auto-start and the reboot of the machine.

* Docker: auto-init the Gerrit site during first start of the container.

  Simplify the configuration and management of Docker setups by automatically
  detecting if a `$GERRIT_SITE/git/All-Projects.git` exists and, if it doesn't,
  invoke the Gerrit init step in batch mode.

## Bugfix Releases

### 3.0.1

* Upgrade JGit to 5.3.1.201904271842-r.

* [Issue 10858](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10858):
Fix starting Gerrit under Tomcat 8.

* [Issue 10664](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10664):
Fix duplicate key detection in MySQL patch review database.

* [Issue 11016](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11016):
Fix failure to initialize on slave.

* [Issue 10763](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10763):
Fix ACLs to allow regexes for tag and ref permissions.

  The documentation states that reference names can also be described with
  a regular expression by prefixing the reference name with `^`, but the UI
  only showed the creation field when a non-regex name was used.

* [Issue 11082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11082):
Close changes oldest first when submitting on push.

* [Issue 11059](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11059):
Fix setting `BLOCK` on partial label range in permissions.

* [Issue 10790](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10790):
Avoid evaluating submit rules twice for open changes.

  Prolog submit rules were evaluated twice per page view for an open change,
  which caused performance degradation on projects defining complex rules.

* [Issue 10943](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10943):
Set `References:` header on new change notification mail.

  GMail changed the way
  [emails are grouped in conversation view](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/03/threading-changes-in-gmail-conversation-view.html),
  which, combined with the fact that
  [Amazon SES changes the `Message-ID` header](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=262855),
  resulted in the new change notification email not being grouped with
  subsequent emails related to the same change.

* [Issue 10952](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10952):
Fix definition of `PID` in `gerrit.sh`.

* [Issue 10852](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10852):
Replication plugin: Fix scheduling starvation.

* [Issue 10896](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10896):
Fix eliding project name without slash in notification emails.

* Show submit button with tooltip when not allowed to submit.

  The submit button was hidden when the user did not have permission to submit,
  or other conditions prevented submit (for example the change being WIP).

* Don't send "GPG keys added" notification when no GPG keys were added.

  A GPG key update can include both addition and removal of GPG keys. The
  notification email for addition of new keys was always sent, even if the
  update only removed keys.

* Update email notifications on changing security related settings.

  Email notifications are now sent when a GPG or SSH key is removed, and
  when the HTTP password is deleted or changed.

  An email notification is now always sent when an SSH key is added to an
  account, even when it was added by an administrator.

  These notifications allow to alert the user if their account is compromised
  and keys or password are altered by the attacker.

* Remove explicit dependency on protobuf_java.

  The protobuf_java library is now consumed from rules_closure.

* Improve performance of migration of accounts to schema 146.

  * Migration of the accounts is parallelized. The default number of threads
    used is the number of available processors. This can be customized using
    the `threadcount` system property.

  * Before the migration, `gc --prune=now` is executed.

  * When hosted on `FileRepository`, refs are packed after migration of every
    1000 accounts.

  * A progress indicator counts every 100 accounts migrated.

* Allow commit validation listeners to ignore the `skip-validation` push option.

  Gerrit allows certain users to skip validation of new commits by passing
  the `skip-validation` push option.

  A new method `shouldValidateAllCommits` is added on the
  `CommitValidationListener`, to allow plugin implemented validators to
  override this option and always be invoked for new commits. The new
  method has a default implementation that returns `false` meaning that
  existing implementations don't need to be modified and will behave the
  same as before.

* Optimize commit and ref operation validation for non-ff push.

  On a non-ff push all the commits were validated before the ref operation
  was validated. On a push with many commits, validating all the commits is
  wasteful in the case where the ref operation is rejected. The logic is
  changed so that the ref operation validation is performed before the commit
  validation.

* Disallow change index task duplication.

  It was possible for multiple index tasks to be queued for the same change.

* Fix formatting issues and inconsistencies in soy email templates.

* Use URL Formatter interface to generate URL in outgoing emails.

* Fix error message when JRE is not found when starting Gerrit.

  The error message recommended to check for a JRE ">= 1.7", but Gerrit requires
  Java 8 minimum.

* Expose the `createProject` method of the `CreateProject` class to plugins.

  This allows plugins to directly invoke the project creation, avoiding the
  checks that are performed when invking via the `apply` method.

* Expose the jsr305 library in the plugin API.

* Upgrade gitiles to 0.2-10.

  Includes a fix for rendering of metalinks in the navigation bar.

* Elasticsearch fixes

  * [Issue 10499](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10499):
  Set default number of shards according to Elasticsearch version.

    In Elasticsearch version 7.0 the default number of shards was reduced from
    5 to 1.

    See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-concepts.html#getting-started-shards-and-replicas)
    for details.

  * [Issue 10496](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10496) and
  [Issue 10844](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10884):
  Fix usage of `include_type_name` in index creation.

  * Add support for Elasticsearch 7.1.

  * Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 7.1.1.

* PolyGerrit UI fixes:

  * Only display 404 page on initial load.

  * Don't reload when viewing dashboard.

  * Fix hiding the HTTP password screen.

    It was possible for the HTTP password to be un-hidden using CSS.

  * Add an extension point to allow adding links to the user header.

* Documentation updates

  * [Issue 10897](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10897):
  Update links to Google individual and corporate CLA pages.

  * Clarify that account must have a username to be able to set HTTP password.

  * Fix formatting in project config documentation.
