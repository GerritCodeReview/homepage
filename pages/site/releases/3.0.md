## Release Highlights

* Removal of GWT UI

  The GWT UI is removed and PolyGerrit is now the only UI.

* Removal of ReviewDb

  The database backend for changes, accounts, groups and projects ("ReviewDb") is
  removed and this metadata is now stored in git ("NoteDb").

  A database is still needed for account patch reviews, which stores the 'reviewed'
  flag for files in a review per user. The default backend is H2, but MySQL,
  PostgreSQL and MariaDb are also supported. See the
  [documentation](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/config-gerrit.html#accountPatchReviewDb)
  for details.

  It is also possible for plugins to provide another backend by implementing the
  [`AccountPatchReviewStore`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#account-patch-review-store)
  interface.

* New quota enforcer extension point.

* [Issue 4040](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4040):
Support for signed push with GPG subkeys.

* New core plugins: `delete-project`, `gitiles`, `plugin-manager`, and `webhooks`.

## Important Notes

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

### Breaking Changes

* Reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default.

  The `gerrit.disableReverseDnsLookup` option with default value false is replaced
  by `gerrit.enableReverseDnsLookp` also with default value false. This means that
  reverse DNS lookup is now disabled by default.

* Private changes will be published (unmarked private) once merged.

  A warning dialog will be displayed to the user to confirm this on submission
  using the UI. When submitted via push, this warning will not be shown. Already
  merged changes cannot be marked private any longer.

* [Issue 8054](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8054):
  Removal of the `urlAlias` configuration settings.

  The URL rewriting feature introduced in 2.12 via the
  [`urlAlias` configuration](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.16.12/config-gerrit.html#urlAlias)
  was only supported in GWT, and thus removed with the 3.0 release.

## New Features

* New quota enforcer extension point.

  Plugins may implement the
  [QuotaEnforcer](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#quota-enforcer)
  interface to enforce
  [quotas](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/dev-plugins.html#quota-enforcer).

* [Issue 4040](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4040):
Support for signed push with GPG subkeys.

  It is now possible to use a GPG subkey when pusing commits with signed push.

* [Issue 6053](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6053):
Support for searching on mobile devices.

* [Issue 8535](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8535):
Support for plugin config entries in the PolyGerrit UI.

  Configuration entries defined by server-side plugins are now displayed
  in the UI.

* New method to get UI top menus in the config API.

* New configuration option
[`change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.0/config-gerrit.html#change.api.excludeMergeableInChangeInfo).

  Computing mergeability of open changes becomes very expensive for hosts
  that have fast-moving branches and a lot of open changes. Setting this
  option to `true` disables it.

* New configuration option
[`change.move`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.3/config-gerrit.html#change.move).

  The `change.move` option allows to disable the "Move Change" REST API.

  Note that the option was included in 3.0.0 but only documented since 3.0.3.

* New core plugins.

  The `delete-project`, `gitiles`, `plugin-manager`, and `webhooks` plugins are
  now core plugins bundled with the release, and can be installed during site
  initialization.

## Dependency Updates

* Add dependency on resemblejs

* Remove dependency on apache derby

* Remove dependency on gwtjsonrpc

* Remove dependency on gwtorm

* Remove dependency on postgresql

## Native packaging

* Upgrade the Docker/Ubuntu image to Ubuntu 18.04

* Upgrade the Docker/CentOS image to CentOS 7.6.1810

* RPM/Deb: Remove Gerrit service start upon package setup.

  Gerrit service is no longer started automatically after the package installation,
  but requires manual invocation of the `/etc/init.d/gerrit start` command, or
  the configuration of the service for auto-start and the reboot of the machine.

* Docker: auto-init the Gerrit site during first start of the container.

  Simplify the configuration and management of Docker setups by automatically
  detecting if a `$GERRIT_SITE/git/All-Projects.git` exists and, if it doesn't,
  invoke the Gerrit init step in batch mode.

## Bugfix Releases

### 3.0.5

* New Features

  * [Issue 11973](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11973):
  Add copy-to-clipboard for generated HTTP password.

  * Add support for doctag in PolyGerrit UI syntax highlighter.

  * Add an event interface in the PolyGerrit API.

  * Add support for Elasticsearch 7.5.

  * Add documentation of how to perform backups of Gerrit.

* Breaking Changes

  * The default and minimum value of `execution.defaultThreadPoolSize` is
  increased to 2.

* PolyGerrit UI Fixes

  * [Issue 11993](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11993):
  Stop loading fonts from external resources.

  * [Issue 11984](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11984):
  Fix top menu bar on iOS.

  * [Issue 8282](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8282):
  Avoid browser caching for diff on edit patch.

  * [Issue 9444](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9444):
  Fix syntax highlighting for multi-char char constants.

  * [Issue 12020](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12020):
  Fix 'New Contributor Agreement' screen.

  * Fix `gr-syntax-params` css class.

  * Fix overflow of branch name in change list.

* Other Fixes

  * [Issue 7645](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7645):
  Fix thread deadlock when loading accounts from the account cache.

    Replacing Guava caches with Caffeine reduces the chances of having the
    deadlocks and improves the cache performance.

  * [Issue 11918](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11918):
  Fix internal server error when deleting a tag or branch by git push.

  * [Issue 5082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=5082):
  Upgrade gitiles blame-cache to 0.2-11 to fix internal server error when getting
  blame for file.

  * Disallow deleting the `refs/meta/config` branch via the 'Delete Branches'
  REST API.

  * Disallow deleting the `HEAD` ref via the 'Delete Branches' REST API.

  * Allow empty base revision in the 'Create Branch' and 'Create Tag'
  REST APIs.

  * Fix deletion of draft comment refs.

    In some situations, draft comment refs were not properly deleted
    but left empty. This resulted in unused draft refs persisting in
    the `All-Users` repository, polluting the namespace. Published draft
    comments as well as deleted draft comments were kept in the history
    of the draft ref, keeping them alive for GC, and causing a steady
    increase of repository size.

  * Use correct content type `text/plain` instead of `plain/text` in 'Create SSH Key'
  REST API.

  * Fix handling of interactive/batch users in the QoS filter.

    For the git-over-http requests this filter didn't work properly because the
    basic authentication happened later in the filter chain and at the moment when
    the QoS filter was invoked the current user was not yet set.

  * Add project name to headers of outgoing change emails.

  * Fix and expand documentation of `ref-update` and `commit-received` hooks
  in the hooks plugin.

  * Upgrade jackson-core to 2.10.1.

### 3.0.4

  * Add a method on `ProjectConfig` to read from the repository.

    Add a method that allows to read the config from the repository without
    having to provide a `MetaDataUpdate` instance.

  * New syntax highlighting files format supported.

    Highlight handlebars, Jinja2, Jenkinsfile, Soy and VHDL formats;
    associate cproj, xaml and svg as xml.

  * New `getConfig()` method in the PolyGerrit Plugin RestApi interface.

    Make the PolyGerrit RestApi interface to retrieve the server config and to cache it,
    accessible to plugins.

  * Add "readOnly" endpoint parameter to repo-config endpoint in PolyGerrit Plugin RestApi.

* PolyGerrit UI Fixes:

  * Hide "HTTP Credentials" if auth is not `HTTP` or `HTTP_LDAP`.

  * [Issue 11782](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11782):
  Fix assignment of CSS style for CodeReview -1 labels within comments.

  * [Issue 7083](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7083):
  Stop query from executing if predicate is empty.

  * [Issue 8513](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=8513):
  Add the SHA hash of each patchset in dropdown menu as it was in the old GWT UI.

  * [Issue 11715](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11715):
  Fix total additions/deletions counters when viewing diff against parent 1 on merge commit.

  * [Issue 11682](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11682):
  Fix some corner-cases in the diff view where the download file feature did not work for
  added, renamed and deleted files.

  * [Issue 10047](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10047):
  Add shortcut to copy ssh-rsa public key.

  * [Issue 7867](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=7867):
  Allow downloading a regular file from the patch set, from both base version
  and specific patch set version. It is implemented as a dropdown.

* Elasticsearch Updates:

  * Add support for Elasticsearch 7.4.

  * Update elasticsearch-rest-client to 7.4.2.

* JGit Updates:

  * Upgrade JGit to 5.3.6.201910020505-r.

    This JGit version brings significant performance improvement in the case when
    Gerrit loads all external-ids from NoteDb. This happens whenever the
    external_ids_map cache gets invalidated or expires.

* Other fixes:

  * Fix internal server error when non-existing base revision is given in input
  to Cherry Pick Change REST API.

  * Remove error log when user tried to delete current branch with the Delete Branch
  REST API endpoint.

  * Fix the response status code when an error occurred in the Delete Branch/Tag REST API
  endpoint.

    The endpoint returned "409 Conflict" but should return "500 Internal Server Error".

  * Fix the response status code then an error occurred in the Update/Delete GPG Keys
  REST API endpoint.

    The endpoint returned "409 Conflict" but should return "500 Internal Server Error".

  * [Issue 9001](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=9001):
  Fix external-id consistency checker e-mail validation.

    Do not enforce emails on external IDs to be globally unique but allow the same e-mail
    repeated multiple times as long as it associated to the same account id.

  * Fix change message when automatically abandoning a change for a project
    that has been deleted.

    The change message and the message tag were inverted.

  * Fix commit message subject when updating project description by REST API.

    The tense of the commit message subject was inconsistent with other similar
    messages.

  * Fix commit timestamp when updating project configurations.

    For some REST API operations that update the project configuration, the
    commit that does the update on `refs/meta/config` had the wrong timestamp.
    Rather than being the time of the actual commit, it was always the time
    of the server startup.

    This was the case for the following operations:

    - Updating the description.
    - Setting the parent project.
    - Updating group names while getting access settings.

  * Upgrade jackson-core to 2.10.0.

    This version includes a fix for [CVE-2019-12384](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12384).

  * Add more detailed debug logging when not sending an outgoing email.

    There are several conditions that could cause sending of an outgoing
    email to be skipped. These are now logged at debug level.

  * Increase severity to error for logging of exceptions during site initialization.

  * [Issue 4824](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=4824):
  Handle multiple `httpd.listenUrl` values.

    Per the [documentation](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.4/config-gerrit.html#httpd.listenUrl),
    multiple values are supported, but if multiple values were specified Gerrit
    would fail to start.

  * Do not overwrite `httpd.listenUrl` during init, until the input has been checked as valid.

    Fix a bug where during the Gerrit init in interactive mode the input was
    invalid for the HTTP daemon settings, but still written to the configuration file.

  * Add `adder` in the `reviewer-added` event.

### 3.0.3

* Breaking Changes

  * The `weblinksOnly` option is removed from the `Get Diff` REST API endpoint.

    This option was only used by the GWT UI which has been removed. This is a
    breaking change for any other clients that are using it.

* New Features

  * [Issue 6029](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=6029):
  Add support for downloading binary files.

  * [Issue 11205](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11205):
  Allow Gerrit admins to reindex a change even when Read access is not allowed
  on its target branch.

  * Extend the [`addMenuLink` method](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.3/pg-plugin-admin-api.html#_addmenulink)
  in the PolyGerrit plugin API to allow plugins to specify a capability that
  users must have in order to view a top menu item provided by the plugin.

  * Utility script `remove-notedb-refs.sh` which can be used to remove all refs
  created for NoteDb in case of rollback to ReviewDb.

  * [Issue 11356](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11356):
  Allow to override autodetected Lucene index configuration.

    The new settings
    [`index.name.maxMergeCount`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.3/config-gerrit.html#index.name.maxMergeCount),
    [`index.name.maxThreadCount`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.3/config-gerrit.html#index.name.maxThreadCount) and
    [`index.name.enableAutoIOThrottle`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.0.3/config-gerrit.html#index.name.enableAutoIOThrottle)
    allow to manually configure the Lucene index, rather than using autodetected
    values, to improve performance.

    and extensions.

  * Fix and expand documentation of REST API to get revision files

  * Fix detecting changes of parent trees when computing change kind for merge
  commit.

    A new patch set of a merge change is considered as NO_CHANGE if the
    commits have the same delta and trees. For merge commits this includes
    comparing the trees of the parent commits.

  * Reduce log spam of "setting reductionLimit" debug messages of the Prolog
  engine.

    If not set, it defaults to 1 which was the previously fixed value.

### 3.0.1

* Upgrade JGit to 5.3.1.201904271842-r.

* [Issue 10858](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10858):
Fix starting Gerrit under Tomcat 8.

* [Issue 10664](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10664):
Fix duplicate key detection in MySQL patch review database.

* [Issue 11016](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11016):
Fix failure to initialize on slave.

* [Issue 10763](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10763):
Fix ACLs to allow regexes for tag and ref permissions.

  The documentation states that reference names can also be described with
  a regular expression by prefixing the reference name with `^`, but the UI
  only showed the creation field when a non-regex name was used.

* [Issue 11082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11082):
Close changes oldest first when submitting on push.

* [Issue 10790](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10790):
Avoid evaluating submit rules twice for open changes.

  Prolog submit rules were evaluated twice per page view for an open change,
  which caused performance degradation on projects defining complex rules.

* [Issue 10943](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10943):
Set `References:` header on new change notification mail.

  GMail changed the way
  [emails are grouped in conversation view](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/03/threading-changes-in-gmail-conversation-view.html),
  which, combined with the fact that
  [Amazon SES changes the `Message-ID` header](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=262855),
  resulted in the new change notification email not being grouped with
  subsequent emails related to the same change.

* [Issue 10952](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10952):
Fix definition of `PID` in `gerrit.sh`.

* [Issue 10852](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10852):
Replication plugin: Fix scheduling starvation.

* [Issue 10896](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10896):
Fix eliding project name without slash in notification emails.

* [Issue 10359](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10359):
LDAP: support servers that do not allow anonymous browsing.

  Add `ldap.supportAnonymous` configuration setting in gerrit.config to support
  servers that do not allow anonymous browsing. Default is true per standard and
  best practice.

* Show submit button with tooltip when not allowed to submit.

  The submit button was hidden when the user did not have permission to submit,
  or other conditions prevented submit (for example the change being WIP).

* Don't send "GPG keys added" notification when no GPG keys were added.

  A GPG key update can include both addition and removal of GPG keys. The
  notification email for addition of new keys was always sent, even if the
  update only removed keys.

* Update email notifications on changing security related settings.

  Email notifications are now sent when a GPG or SSH key is removed, and
  when the HTTP password is deleted or changed.

  An email notification is now always sent when an SSH key is added to an
  account, even when it was added by an administrator.

  These notifications allow to alert the user if their account is compromised
  and keys or password are altered by the attacker.

* Remove explicit dependency on protobuf_java.

  The protobuf_java library is now consumed from rules_closure.

* Improve performance of migration of accounts to schema 146.

  * Migration of the accounts is parallelized. The default number of threads
    used is the number of available processors. This can be customized using
    the `threadcount` system property.

  * Before the migration, `gc --prune=now` is executed.

  * When hosted on `FileRepository`, refs are packed after migration of every
    1000 accounts.

  * A progress indicator counts every 100 accounts migrated.

* Allow commit validation listeners to ignore the `skip-validation` push option.

  Gerrit allows certain users to skip validation of new commits by passing
  the `skip-validation` push option.

  A new method `shouldValidateAllCommits` is added on the
  `CommitValidationListener`, to allow plugin implemented validators to
  override this option and always be invoked for new commits. The new
  method has a default implementation that returns `false` meaning that
  existing implementations don't need to be modified and will behave the
  same as before.

* Optimize commit and ref operation validation for non-ff push.

  On a non-ff push all the commits were validated before the ref operation
  was validated. On a push with many commits, validating all the commits is
  wasteful in the case where the ref operation is rejected. The logic is
  changed so that the ref operation validation is performed before the commit
  validation.

* Disallow change index task duplication.

  It was possible for multiple index tasks to be queued for the same change.

* Fix formatting issues and inconsistencies in soy email templates.

* Use URL Formatter interface to generate URL in outgoing emails.

* Fix error message when JRE is not found when starting Gerrit.

  The error message recommended to check for a JRE ">= 1.7", but Gerrit requires
  Java 8 minimum.

* Expose the `createProject` method of the `CreateProject` class to plugins.

  This allows plugins to directly invoke the project creation, avoiding the
  checks that are performed when invking via the `apply` method.

* Expose the jsr305 library in the plugin API.

* Upgrade gitiles to 0.2-10.

  Includes a fix for rendering of metalinks in the navigation bar.

* Elasticsearch Fixes

  * [Issue 10499](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10499):
  Set default number of shards according to Elasticsearch version.

    In Elasticsearch version 7.0 the default number of shards was reduced from
    5 to 1.

    See the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-concepts.html#getting-started-shards-and-replicas)
    for details.

  * [Issue 10496](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10496) and
  [Issue 10844](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10884):
  Fix usage of `include_type_name` in index creation.

  * Add support for Elasticsearch 7.1.

  * Upgrade elasticsearch-rest-client to 7.1.1.

* PolyGerrit UI Fixes

  * Only display 404 page on initial load.

  * Don't reload when viewing dashboard.

  * Fix hiding the HTTP password screen.

    It was possible for the HTTP password to be un-hidden using CSS.

  * Add an extension point to allow adding links to the user header.

* Documentation Updates

  * [Issue 10897](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10897):
  Update links to Google individual and corporate CLA pages.

  * Clarify that account must have a username to be able to set HTTP password.

  * Fix formatting in project config documentation.
