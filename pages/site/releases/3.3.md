## Important notes

### Default support for Java 11

The java language level is now set to Java 11 by default for Gerrit.

* [Issue 13494](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13494);
  Generate a Java 11 Eclipse project by default

* Update dev-{eclipse,intellij} development for Java 11.

### Schema changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

Upgrading to this schema version (184) renames the `Non-Interactive Users`
group to `Service Users`.

### Zero-downtime Upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.2 when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
when the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

For upgrading with zero-downtime, you should enable the rolling upgrade migration
in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers by setting the
[`gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html)
to `true`.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit operation
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers upgraded to v3.2 in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.
3. Set the first Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the first Gerrit server, upgrade to v3.3 and start Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the first Gerrit server is working properly and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the first Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for the second Gerrit server.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.

**NOTE**: The schema version 184 is tolerated by the Gerrit v3.2 because the group-id
of the `Non-Interactive Users` remains the same, hence all existing ACLs are evaluated
as expected also when the group is renamed to `Service Users`. During steps 4, 5 and 6, the Gerrit
server still running v3.2 will display `Service Users` on the repositories ACLs screen.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.2.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.3.x server
2. Bump the All-Projects.git version (refname: `refs/meta/version`) to `183`
   (see [git hash-object](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) and
   [git update-ref](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-ref))
3. Revert the All-Users.git schema-184 migration commit (refname: `refs/meta/group-names`)
4. Run Gerrit v3.2.x init
5. Startup Gerrit v3.2.x server

### Breaking changes

* [New logs timestamp format](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/logs.html):

  The new format supports both ISO-8601 and RFC3339, which means that if you are
  parsing it as general ISO-8601 it should work as before. However you will be
  affected if you are parsing the timestamp with a static format.

### ChangeAttributeFactory deprecated and ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory supported

Similar to the ChangeAttributeFactory, a ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory allows
plugins to [provide additional data in change results](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/dev-plugins.html#query_attributes).
ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory has the advantage that it allows plugins to know
the full set of changes up front so that they can do bulk operations.

ChangeAttributeFactory will be removed in the next release.

### JGit auto-configuration

## Auto-disable `receive.autogc` option

By JGit's default, `git-receive-pack` will run auto gc after receiving
data from git-push and updating refs.

Init step is added to auto-disable `receive.autogc` configuration option in
`$gerrit_site/etc/jgit.config` file. By JGit's default, `git-receive-pack` will
run auto gc after receiving data from git-push and updating refs.

Disable this behavior in Gerrit init to avoid the additional load it
creates: gc should be configured in gc config section or run as a
separate process.

## Auto-enable git wire protocol version 2

By JGit's default, git wire protocol version 2 is disabled. Given, that git
wire protocol version 2 on server side is considered to be now very stable,
activate it per default in init site program, so that gerrit sites benefit
form improved fetch performance.

## Security fixes

* [Issue 13621](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13621);
  [CVE-2020-8919](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8919):
  Make `PermissionBackend#ForRef` authoritative.

  Fixes a misconception that leads to data being accessible through Gerrit
  APIs that should be locked down.

  Gerrit had two components for determining if a Git ref is visible to a
  user: `(Default)RefFilter` and `PermissionBackend#ForRef` (e.g.,
  `RefControl`). The former was always capable of providing correct results
  for all refs. The latter only had logic to decide if a Git ref is visible
  according to the Gerrit `READ` permissions. This includes all refs under
  `refs/heads` as well as any other ref that isn't a database ref or a Git
  tag. This component was unaware of Git tags and notedb-related refs. Hence,
  when asked for a database reference such as `refs/changes/xx/yyyyxx/meta`,
  the logic would allow access if the user has `READ` permissions on any of
  the ref prefixes (such as the default "read refs/* Anonymous Users").

  That was problematic, because it bypassed
  [documented behavior](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/access-control.html)
  where a user should only have access to a change if he can see the
  destination ref. The same goes for other database references.

* [Issue 13514](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13514);
  [CVE-2020-8919](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8919):
  Work around Gitiles bug on `All-Users` visibility.

  Gitiles has a special `FilteredRepository` wrapper that allows carefully
  hiding refs based on the project's ACLs. There is however an optimization
  that skips the filtering in case a user has `READ` permissions on every ACL
  pattern(s). When the target repository is `All-Users`, the optimization
  turns into a security issue because it allows seeing all personal information
  associated with all accounts, i.e.:

  * draft comments
  * draft edits
  * personally identifiable information (PII) of all users
  * external ids

  This fix now blocks Gitiles or any other part of Gerrit to abuse this power
  when the target repository is `All-Users`, where nobody can be authorized
  to skip the ACLs evaluation anyway.

* [Issue 12629](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12629);
  Verify hostname when sending emails via SMTP server with `SMTPSClient`.

  The SMTP server's certificate and hostname must be verified if
  encryption is enabled with SSL verification in the host settings
  (`sendemail.smtpEncryption` and `sendemail.sslVerify`).

  `SMTPSClient` from Apache Commons Net used for SSL processing.
  It has the following downside: if encryption is not required,
  `SMTPSClient` is used in 'explicit' mode with the upgrade to TLS
  never called. Thus, the client is somewhat misused.

## Native packaging

* Allow to use init as a param in docker run

  This allows to easily run the Gerrit image with the `init` argument to explicitly
  re-run the initialization on an existing or new site.

* CentOS docker image upgrade to v8.2.2004

## New features

* [Attention Set](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/user-attention-set.html):

  For every change Gerrit maintains an "Attention Set" with users that are
  currently expected to act on the change. Both on the dashboard and on the
  change page, this is expressed by an arrow icon before the user name.

  Enabled by default.
  The former assignee feature is therefore now disabled by default.

* Reply dialog posts patchset level comments instead of change messages.

* [Issue 13670](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13670);
  Introduce cache.openFiles setting in gerrit.config.

  Persistent caches might require the allocation of additional file
  descriptors depending on their configuration and backend engine.
  This new setting allows the gerrit.sh to be aware of that and increase the
  number of files accordingly before starting Gerrit.

  E.g. when swapping the default H2 persistent cache implementation with the
  [chronicle-map implementation](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/modules/cache-chroniclemap/+/refs/heads/stable-3.3)
  the number of open files needs raising, since the latter is bound to open more
  file descriptors, mostly due to its usage of memory mapped files.

### REST API changes

* Reject REST requests with invalid enum values as bad request

* Expose 'Service User' tag on the REST API

* Add endpoints to allow enhancement on submit requirements

* Add parameter for added reviewers on reply-reviewers endpoint

* Add an alternate `CreateChange` endpoint

* [Issue 13357](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13357);
  Add the work_in_progress option to the revert and revertSubmission endpoints

## End-to-end tests

* [Issue 12208](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12208);
  Add [presentation links](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/presentations.html#list-of-presentations)
  to [documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/dev-e2e-tests.html#_what_is_gatling)

* [Issue 13082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13082);
  Add Eclipse support for Gatling tests

## Plugin changes

### delete-project

* [Issue 13402](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13402);
  Fix event handling on error

### download-commands

* New command: "Reset To"

  Add a new command that allows to reset the current branch to the commit
  that was fetched. This is useful in cases when the user is working on a
  local branch and the existing commands are not appropriate:

  * "Checkout" will check out the FETCH_HEAD, i.e. moving off the current
    branch and leaving the local repository in 'detached head' state.

  * "Cherry-Pick" will commit the fetched change again, resulting in a
    'new' commit (i.e. changed sha1) which will result in a new patch set
    if the user creates any commits on top of it and pushes for review.

* [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021);
  Avoid quoting on basic strings

### plugin-manager

* [Issue 12885](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12885);
  Fix loading of core plugins on Windows

### replication

* Add method to push changes directly to given replica

  This makes it possible to push changes directly to given replica
  instance without sending unnecessary requests to others.

  The method is intended to be used by other plugins that extend the
  replication plugin.

* Prevent persistent task listing interruptions on IOExceptions

  Improved the logging by differentiating between failures that are
  severe versus potentially related to other node actions since in a
  multi-primary scenario with shared storage, it is common for operations
  on one node to "interfere" with task listing operations on another node
  without causing a malfunction. Specifically, improve the exception
  handling so that the logging in these latter cases have a likely
  explanation of the listing error, and do not consider these specific
  filesystem errors operational errors.

  **NOTE**: The multi-primary replication is still experimental.

* [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769);
  Fix synopsis in replication start cmd documentation

  `--url` is usable with `--all` or projects and on its own.
  Updated the usage to reflect this.

* [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769);
  Don't wait for pending events to process on startup

  Previously, on large Gerrit installations with many projects and/or many
  replication destinations, the replication plugin could take very long
  periods of time to startup. This was particularly a problem if the
  pending (persisted) event count was large as they all were rescheduled
  before the plugin finished initializing. Change this behavior so that
  startup merely begins the process of scheduling the pending events, but
  does not wait for them to complete.

* [Issue 13480](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13480);
  Don't output directories during task walk
