## Release highlights

## Important notes

### Default Support for Java 11

### Schema changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

Upgrading to this schema version (184) renames the `Non-Interactive Users`
group to `Service Users`.

### Breaking changes

* [New logs timestamp format](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/logs.html):

  The new format supports both ISO-8601 and RFC3339, which means that if you are
  parsing it as general ISO-8601 it should work as before. However you will be
  affected if you are parsing the timestamp with a static format.

## Native packaging

## New features

* [Attention Set](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/user-attention-set.html):

  For every change Gerrit maintains an "Attention Set" with users that are
  currently expected to act on the change. Both on the dashboard and on the
  change page, this is expressed by an arrow icon before the user name.

  Disabled by default, enable by setting [change.enableAttentionSet](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/config-gerrit.html#change.enableAttentionSet).

  Feature fixes since inception:

  * [Issue 13183](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13183):
    Fix adding users to attention set for merged/abandoned changes.

  * [Issue 13214](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13214):
    Ensure owner and uploader are not added to attention set as reviewers.

  * [Issue 13225](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13225):
    Ensure reviewers are not added to the attention set when voting.

  * [Issue 13251](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13251):
    Fix adding users to attention set for merged/abandoned changes.

  * [Issue 13351](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13351):
    Disable the attention icon button in the reply dialog "Modify" section.

### REST APIs

* Accounts
* Changes
* Groups
* Projects

## End-to-end tests

## Plugin changes

### delete-project

* Fix event handling on error
  * [Issue 13402](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13402)

### download-commands

* New command: "Reset To"

  Add a new command that allows to reset the current branch to the commit
  that was fetched. This is useful in cases when the user is working on a
  local branch and the existing commands are not appropriate:

  * "Checkout" will check out the FETCH_HEAD, i.e. moving off the current
    branch and leaving the local repository in 'detached head' state.

  * "Cherry-Pick" will commit the fetched change again, resulting in a
    'new' commit (i.e. changed sha1) which will result in a new patch set
    if the user creates any commits on top of it and pushes for review.

* avoid quoting on basic strings
  * [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021)

### replication

* Add method to push changes directly to given replica.

  This makes it possible to push changes directly to given replica
  instance without sending unnecessary requests to others.

  The method is intended to be used by other plugins that extend the
  replication plugin.

* Fix synopsis in replication start cmd documentation
  * [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769)

    `--url` is usable with `--all` or projects and on its own.
    Updated the usage to reflect this.

* Don't wait for pending events to process on startup
  * [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769)

    Previously, on large Gerrit installations with many projects and/or many
    replication destinations, the replication plugin could take very long
    periods of time to startup. This was particularly a problem if the
    pending (persisted) event count was large as they all were rescheduled
    before the plugin finished initializing. Change this behavior so that
    startup merely begins the process of scheduling the pending events, but
    does not wait for them to complete.

* Make persistent task keys stable
  * [Issue 11760](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11760)

* Prevent persistent task listing interruptions on IOExceptions

  Improved the logging by differentiating between failures that are
  severe versus potentially related to other node actions since in a
  multi-primary scenario with shared storage, it is common for operations
  on one node to "interfere" with task listing operations on another node
  without causing a malfunction. Specifically, improve the exception
  handling so that the logging in these latter cases have a likely
  explanation of the listing error, and do not consider these specific
  filesystem errors operational errors.

  **NOTE**: The multi-primary replication is still experimental.

* Fix firing pending "..all.." events on startup
  * [Issue 11745](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=11745)
  * [Issue 12592](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12592)

* Fix extensibility of replication configuration parsing
  * [Issue 12720](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12720)

    This situation was causing a regression for plugins that extend the
    replication plugin (e.g. pull-replication) because they are expecting
    a different remote configuration class.

* GerritRestApi: Fix logging of exceptions
  * [Issue 12678](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12678)

* ReplicationTasksStorage: Handle DirectoryIteratorExceptions
  * [Issue 12687](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12687)
