## Release highlights

* Java 11 by default for Gerrit

* New logs timestamp format

* Attention Set

## Important notes

### Default support for Java 11

The java language level is now set to Java 11 by default for Gerrit.

* [Issue 13494](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13494);
  Generate a Java 11 Eclipse project by default

* Update dev-{eclipse,intellij} development for Java 11.

### Schema changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

Upgrading to this schema version (184) renames the `Non-Interactive Users`
group to `Service Users`.

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.2 when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
when the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

For upgrading with zero-downtime, you should enable the rolling upgrade migration
in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers by setting the
[`gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade`](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.2.0/config-gerrit.html)
to `true`.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit operation
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers upgraded to v3.2 in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.
3. Set the first Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the first Gerrit server, upgrade to v3.3 and start Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the first Gerrit server is working properly and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the first Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for the second Gerrit server.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit servers.

**NOTE**: The schema version 184 is tolerated by the Gerrit v3.2 because the group-id
of the `Non-Interactive Users` remains the same, hence all existing ACLs are evaluated
as expected also when the group is renamed to `Service Users`. During steps 4, 5 and 6, the Gerrit
server still running v3.2 will display `Service Users` on the repositories ACLs screen.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.2.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.3.x server
2. Bump the All-Projects.git version (refname: `refs/meta/version`) to `183`
   (see [git hash-object](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) and
   [git update-ref](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-ref))
3. Revert the All-Users.git schema-184 migration commit (refname: `refs/meta/group-names`)
4. Run Gerrit v3.2.x init
5. Startup Gerrit v3.2.x server

### Breaking changes

* [New logs timestamp format](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.1/logs.html):

  The new format supports both ISO-8601 and RFC3339, which means that if you are
  parsing it as general ISO-8601 it should work as before. However you will be
  affected if you are parsing the timestamp with a static format.

### ChangeAttributeFactory deprecated and ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory supported

Similar to the ChangeAttributeFactory, a ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory allows
plugins to [provide additional data in change results](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.1/dev-plugins.html#query_attributes).
ChangePluginDefinedInfoFactory has the advantage that it allows plugins to know
the full set of changes up front so that they can do bulk operations.

ChangeAttributeFactory will be removed in the next release.

### JGit auto-configuration

#### Auto-disable `receive.autogc` option

By JGit's default, `git-receive-pack` will run auto gc after receiving
data from git-push and updating refs.

Init step is added to auto-disable `receive.autogc` configuration option
in `$gerrit_site/etc/jgit.config` file.

#### Auto-enable git wire protocol version 2

By JGit's default, git wire protocol version 2 is disabled. Given, that git
wire protocol version 2 on the server side is considered to be now very stable,
activate it per default in init site program, so that gerrit sites benefit
from improved fetch performance.

## Security fixes

* [Issue 13621](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13621);
  [CVE-2020-8919](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8919):
  Make `PermissionBackend#ForRef` authoritative.

  Fixes a misconception that leads to data being accessible through Gerrit
  APIs that should be locked down.

  Gerrit had two components for determining if a Git ref is visible to a
  user: `(Default)RefFilter` and `PermissionBackend#ForRef` (e.g.,
  `RefControl`). The former was always capable of providing correct results
  for all refs. The latter only had logic to decide if a Git ref is visible
  according to the Gerrit `READ` permissions. This includes all refs under
  `refs/heads` as well as any other ref that isn't a database ref or a Git
  tag. This component was unaware of Git tags and notedb-related refs. Hence,
  when asked for a database reference such as `refs/changes/xx/yyyyxx/meta`,
  the logic would allow access if the user has `READ` permissions on any of
  the ref prefixes (such as the default "read refs/* Anonymous Users").

  That was problematic, because it bypassed
  [documented behavior](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.1/access-control.html)
  where a user should only have access to a change if he can see the
  destination ref. The same goes for other database references.

* [Issue 13514](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13514);
  [CVE-2020-8920](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8920):
  Work around Gitiles bug on `All-Users` visibility.

  Gitiles has a special `FilteredRepository` wrapper that allows carefully
  hiding refs based on the project's ACLs. There is however an optimization
  that skips the filtering in case a user has `READ` permissions on every ACL
  pattern(s). When the target repository is `All-Users`, the optimization
  turns into a security issue because it allows seeing all personal information
  associated with all accounts, i.e.:

  * draft comments
  * draft edits
  * personally identifiable information (PII) of all users
  * external ids

  This fix now blocks Gitiles or any other part of Gerrit to abuse this power
  when the target repository is `All-Users`, where nobody can be authorized
  to skip the ACLs evaluation anyway.

* [Issue 12629](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12629);
  Verify hostname when sending emails via SMTP server with `SMTPSClient`.

  The SMTP server's certificate and hostname must be verified if
  encryption is enabled with SSL verification in the host settings
  (`sendemail.smtpEncryption` and `sendemail.sslVerify`).

  `SMTPSClient` from Apache Commons Net used for SSL processing.
  It has the following downside: if encryption is not required,
  `SMTPSClient` is used in 'explicit' mode with the upgrade to TLS
  never called. Thus, the client is somewhat misused.

## Native packaging

* Allow to use init as a param in docker run

  This allows to easily run the Gerrit image with the `init` argument to explicitly
  re-run the initialization on an existing or new site.

* CentOS docker image upgrade to v8.2.2004

## New features

* [Attention Set](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.1/user-attention-set.html):

  For every change Gerrit maintains an "Attention Set" with users that are
  currently expected to act on the change. Both on the dashboard and on the
  change page, this is expressed by an arrow icon before the user name.

  Enabled by default.
  The former assignee feature is therefore now disabled by default.

* The reply dialog posts patchset level comments instead of change messages.

  This is an experiment that is enabled by default. However, it can be
  disabled by adding 'UiFeature__patchset_comments' as disabled key in
  [experiments section of gerrit.config](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#experiments).
  This is useful if your CI system parses back change messages (e.g.
  "/rerun") and has not been updated yet to parse patchset level
  comments. The option to revert this behavior will be removed in
  Gerrit 3.4. Until then, administrators need to have migrated.

* [Issue 13670](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13670);
  Introduce cache.openFiles setting in gerrit.config.

  Persistent caches might require the allocation of additional file
  descriptors depending on their configuration and backend engine.
  This new setting allows the gerrit.sh to be aware of that and increase the
  number of files accordingly before starting Gerrit.

  E.g. when swapping the default H2 persistent cache implementation with the
  [chronicle-map implementation](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/modules/cache-chroniclemap/+/refs/heads/stable-3.3)
  the number of open files needs raising, since the latter is bound to open more
  file descriptors, mostly due to its usage of memory mapped files.

### REST API changes

* Reject REST requests with invalid enum values as bad request

* Expose 'Service User' tag on the REST API

* Add endpoints to allow enhancement on submit requirements

* Add parameter for added reviewers on reply-reviewers endpoint

* Add an alternate `CreateChange` endpoint

* [Issue 13357](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13357);
  Add the work_in_progress option to the revert and revertSubmission endpoints

## End-to-end tests

* [Issue 12208](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12208);
  Add [presentation links](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/presentations.html#list-of-presentations)
  to [documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.1/dev-e2e-tests.html#_what_is_gatling)

* [Issue 13082](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13082);
  Add Eclipse support for Gatling tests

## Plugin changes

### delete-project

* [Issue 13402](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13402);
  Fix event handling on error

### download-commands

* New command: "Reset To"

  Add a new command that allows to reset the current branch to the commit
  that was fetched. This is useful in cases when the user is working on a
  local branch and the existing commands are not appropriate:

  * "Checkout" will check out the FETCH_HEAD, i.e. moving off the current
    branch and leaving the local repository in 'detached head' state.

  * "Cherry-Pick" will commit the fetched change again, resulting in a
    'new' commit (i.e. changed sha1) which will result in a new patch set
    if the user creates any commits on top of it and pushes for review.

* [Issue 10021](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10021);
  Avoid quoting on basic strings

### plugin-manager

* [Issue 12885](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12885);
  Fix loading of core plugins on Windows

### replication

* Add method to push changes directly to given replica

  This makes it possible to push changes directly to given replica
  instance without sending unnecessary requests to others.

  The method is intended to be used by other plugins that extend the
  replication plugin.

* Prevent persistent task listing interruptions on IOExceptions

  Improved the logging by differentiating between failures that are
  severe versus potentially related to other node actions since in a
  multi-primary scenario with shared storage, it is common for operations
  on one node to "interfere" with task listing operations on another node
  without causing a malfunction. Specifically, improve the exception
  handling so that the logging in these latter cases have a likely
  explanation of the listing error, and do not consider these specific
  filesystem errors operational errors.

  **NOTE**: The multi-primary replication is still experimental.

* [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769);
  Fix synopsis in replication start cmd documentation

  `--url` is usable with `--all` or projects and on its own.
  Updated the usage to reflect this.

* [Issue 12769](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12769);
  Don't wait for pending events to process on startup

  Previously, on large Gerrit installations with many projects and/or many
  replication destinations, the replication plugin could take very long
  periods of time to startup. This was particularly a problem if the
  pending (persisted) event count was large as they all were rescheduled
  before the plugin finished initializing. Change this behavior so that
  startup merely begins the process of scheduling the pending events, but
  does not wait for them to complete.

* [Issue 13480](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13480);
  Don't output directories during task walk

## JGit changes

* [Issue 13544](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13544);
  Ensure that `GC#deleteOrphans` respects pack lock.

  If pack or index files are guarded by a pack lock (`.keep` file),
  `deleteOrphans()` should not touch the respective files protected by the
  lock file. Otherwise it may interfere with `PackInserter` concurrently

* New Features

  * [Issue 14895](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=14895):
  Support author:self and committer:self in change queries

    It is possible to use `self` for searching own changes (for both author and
    committer predicates).

  * [Issue 14930](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=14930):
    Include `Command-Status` in the `httpd_log` and the `httpd_log.json`

    Indicates the overall result of the GIT _command_ over HTTP.

    Refer to the [docs](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.7/logs.html#_httpd_log)
    for more details.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 9812](https://crbug.com/gerrit/9812) [Issue 7338](https://crbug.com/gerrit/7338):
  Merge commit cannot be moved

     If a merge was targetting branch A, but then it was decided to create
     a new branch for this merge named B, which starts from A - The merge
     is still valid for B, and the user has no way to move it without amending
     and creating a new change.

  * [Issue 15024](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15024):
  Gerrit event json formatter produces inconsistent payload for different projects

     AllProjectsName and AllUsersName were serialised as: {"name":"All-Projects"} and {"name":"All-Users"}
     while all other projects were serialised as a JSON string. The different JSON
     payloads were causing issues with the HA configuration using the
     [high-availability plugin](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability).

  * [Issue 14968](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14968):
  PluginServletContext does not implement javax.servlet.ServletContext.getVirtualServerName()

     j.s.ServletContext.getVirtualServerName(), when running Gerrit on Tomcat 8.5.69.

### 3.3.6

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 14732](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14732):
  Commits/IncludedIn exposes branch names without respecting the ACLs on branches

     When calling the REST endpoint for listing all branches that a commit SHA1
     is part of, the commit is properly checked for visibility against the ACLs
     (it is a REST resource) but the branches are not checked.

     The included-in may expose the list of non-visible branches to a user that
     has visibility of the SHA1.

  * [Issue 7282](https://crbug.com/gerrit/7282):
  Hide repository name and description when user has no access

     Gitiles did not respect Gerrit's permission and would show the repo name
     and description to any user who could guess the name.
     The repositories list as well as the content APIs were not affected.

* New Features

  * Pop up accounts when typing within assignee or attention on the searchbar

  * Add attention operator for auto-complete on the searchbar

  Limit returned changes for a triplet without Change-Id

    Fix a bug where invoking the REST-API /changes/repo~branch~ without
    mentioning the change-id resulted in the full scan of all changes
    on a repository/branch causing a high CPU overload and occupying
    the request threads for a long time.

  * [Issue 14776](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14776):
  Prevent removing e-mail associated with OpenID external IDs

    Gerrit prevents the user from removing the email address

    SQLSTATE value, not the MariaDB/mysql error code.
    Fix the removal of duplicate key detection when an already reviewed file
    opened up again returned 500 because of the incorrect handling of SQLSTATE
    value.

  * [Change 312382](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/312382):

    This fixes an issue where if using contenteditable (default on mobile)
    and you typed "/", it would get intercepted within the app.

* Dependency Updates

  * Update CodeMirror to 5.62.2.

     Fix an issue on mobile where typing causes the keyboard line to go out

### 3.3.5

* Breaking Changes

### 3.3.4

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 13721](https://crbug.com/gerrit/13721):
  Don't serve polygerrit assets for git requests

    After migration to Polymer UI, PolyGerrit static resources are mounted at
    the root of the gerrit URL, and would collide with project namespaces, so that
    the project with these prefixes cannot be served with Git over HTTP protocol.

  * Fix `EqualsLabelPredicate` to not fail when calling match() from a plugin

    Calling `match()` on the `EqualsLabelPredicate` returned from
    `ChangeQueryBuilder.parse()` in a plugin fails when in the context of an
    HTTP query.

  * Fix registration redirect on OpenID

  * Log when a new SSH connection is rejected due to exceeded limit

    When the `sshd.maxConnectionsPerUser` got exceeded for a user, new
    connections from that user were rejected but no log entry was reported.

  * [Issue 14127](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14127):
  Fix binding of DELETE REST calls from plugins.

    The processing of the DELETE request actually never reached the
    delete-project plugin due to bug in the RestApiServlet which wrongly
    delegated the request to a child collection in Gerrit core.

  * [Issue 13140](https://crbug.com/gerrit/13140):
  OpenID: Remove support for Yahoo! OpenID provider.

    Yahoo! discontinued support for OpenID provider:
    "OpenID2 will be EOLed on 6/30/20"

  * [Issue 14246](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14246):
  Creation of internal account does not respect `auth.userNameToLowerCase`.

    The CreateAccount SSH command and REST API was able to create accounts
    with usernames that contained uppercase letters even if
    `auth.userNameToLowerCase` was set to true.

  * [Issue 14490](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14490):
  Missing LDAP metrics for authentication.

    Expose the LDAP metrics in terms of latency and call rates so that any
    problem can be highlighted early on and potentially alerted to the Gerrit
    admin.

  * [Issue 14497](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14497):
  Git/HTTP traffic overloads LDAP with duplicate authentication requests.

    When authenticating incoming Git calls over HTTP the BasicAuth filter was
    called 3 times per call triggering multiple authentications against the
    backend.

  * [Issue 14508](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14508):
  Allow GerritAccount Cookie authentication for Git/HTTP.

    Allow to create a Gerrit session from the GerritAccount cookie set on the
    Git client, so that only the first HTTP call will actually authenticate
    and create a session whilst all the others would just reuse the existing
    cookie.

  * [Issue 14553](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14553):
  Gerrit REST-API fails when using /a/ prefix and cookies

    Recent fix to support GerritAccount Cookie authentication for Git/HTTP
    broke existing Python (or other) scripting when performing automation with
    Gerrit REST-API. That is due to the generation of the GerritAccount cookie
    in the HTTP response, which Python automatically manages to reuse in
    subsequent calls.

  * [Issue 11142](https://crbug.com/gerrit/11142):
  ssh to gerrit with no args requires standard input to terminate.

  * [JGit Issue 552173](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=552173)

  Polygerrit: Remove license headers in minified gr-app.js.

* Replication plugin fixes

  * Don't check read permission when authgroup isn't set.

    Do not check for read permission when authGroup is not set since
    the user is a RemoteSiteUser that is-an InternalUser having
    read access to everything. This fixes a regression introduced in v3.1.10
    that prevented the All-Users.git repository to be fully replicated to
    Gerrit replicas.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 13803](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13803):
  Limit number of ambiguous accounts in error message.

### 3.3.1

* Breaking changes

  * Elasticsearch: support for [EOL version](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
    6.8 is discontinued. This was the last supported minor version of
    Elasticsearch 6 in Gerrit. From this release, Gerrit no longer supports V6
    but only the already supported versions 7.x of Elasticsearch.

    * Speaking of which, support for 7.0 and 7.1 is discontinued too, as both
      elasticsearch versions also became [EOL](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)
      recently.

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 12629](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=12629):
  Verify hostname when sending emails via SMTP server with SMTPSClient.

    The SMTP server's certificate and hostname must be verified if
    encryption is enabled with SSL verification in the host settings
    (`sendemail.smtpEncryption` and `sendemail.sslVerify`).

* PolyGerrit Fixes

  * Remove requesting DETAILED_LABELS for the dashboard.

  * [Issue 13785](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13785)
  Add z-index to gr-main-header to avoid the box shadows being hidden behind the content.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 13544](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13544)
  Ensure that GC#deleteOrphans respects pack lock:

    If pack or index files are guarded by a pack lock (.keep file)
    deleteOrphans() should not touch the respective files protected by the
    lock file.

  * [Issue 13775](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13775)
  Honor `toogleWipState` permission for `%ready` `%wip` push options:

  * [Issue 13781](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13781)
  Compact the REST-API output JSON unconditionally:

    The output JSON was initially compacted only when
    the Accept header was set to `application/json`: the compaction is now
    done unconditionally, unless the `pp=1` query parameter is specified.

  * [Issue 13786](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13786)
  ForRef#check should permit internal users to read all refs:

    [Make `PermissionBackend#ForRef` authoritative change](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/288925)
    introduced a regression where gerrit `internal users` (e.g. plugins) were
    not taken into consideration when checking READ permission. As consequence
    the `All-Users.git` repository did not get any of the user's refs replicated
    to the slaves. After the upgrade it is required to trigger a forced replication
    of the `All-Users.git` repository manually.

  * Avoid logging ssh exception for __stream is already closed__ when length=0
    if present in the stacktrace.

  * Adapt Bazel/RBE build to produce Java 11 language level.

  * Make UI experiments configurable from gerrit.config.

    Allows users who upgrade Gerrit to make use of experimental features or
    temporarily revert to previous behavior in case the new behavior breaks them
    (e.g. turn off patch-set-level comments in 3.3 which breaks some CI workflows).

  * [Issue 13800](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=13800)
  Expose patch set level comment in stream event.

* Documentation Updates

  * Clarify that 'm' push option sets patch set description.

  * Clarify that disk cache metrics require `cache.enableDiskStatMetrics`.

* Dependency Updates

  * Upgrade commons-io to 2.4.

  * Upgrade testcontainers to 1.15.1.
