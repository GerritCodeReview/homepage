## Release Highlights

## Important Notes

### Default Support for Java 11

### Schema Changes

This release contains schema changes. To upgrade:

``` sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
```

Upgrading to this schema version (184) renames the `Non-Interactive Users`
group to `Service Users`.

### Native Packaging

### Breaking Changes

* [New logs timestamp format](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/logs.html):

  The new format supports both ISO-8601 and RFC3339, which means that if you are
  parsing it as general ISO-8601 it should work as before. However you will be
  affected if you are parsing the timestamp with a static format.

## New Features

* [Attention Set](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/user-attention-set.html):

  For every change Gerrit maintains an "Attention Set" with users that are
  currently expected to act on the change. Both on the dashboard and on the
  change page, this is expressed by an arrow icon before the user name.

  Disabled by default, enable by setting [change.enableAttentionSet](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.3.0/config-gerrit.html#change.enableAttentionSet)
