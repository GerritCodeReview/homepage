## Release highlights

### Case-insensitive usernames

Users can login with mixed case usernames without the risk to create
duplicate accounts.

The change affects the following external ids:
* `gerrit`   (LDAP)
* `username` (login, authenticated REST and git endpoints)

For a new Gerrit setup, usernames are case insensitive by default, while for
existing installations the Gerrit admin can switch the functionality on/off
using the [`auth.userNameCaseInsensitive`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#auth.userNameCaseInsensitive)
setting in `gerrit.config`.

> **NOTE**: In the All-Users.git repository, the SHA-1 sum of the account
> is computed preserving the case of the external ID. See the full details
> in the [Gerrit config accounts documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-accounts.html#external-ids). Existing accounts can be migrated to
> the new SHA-1 sum using the
> [ChangeExternalIdCaseSensitivity](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/pgm-ChangeExternalIdCaseSensitivity.html)
> migration tool.

### Request cancellation and execution deadlines

To limit the maximal execution time for requests, administrators can configure
server-side deadlines. More details are available in the
[Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-request-cancellation-and-deadlines.html).

Any operation in Gerrit can now be subject to a configurable deadline, using
the [`deadline`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#deadline.id)
section in `gerrit.config`.

> **NOTE**: Deadlines are supported for `REST`, `SSH` and `GIT_RECEIVE`
> requests, but not for `GIT_UPLOAD` requests.

Gerrit commands can define an execution deadline, so that the processing
triggered on the server would be able to end in a definite time, even in case
of network interruption of the connection with the client.

### Removal of external ids

Gerrit external ids, including the username, can now be removed using the
[SSH command](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/cmd-set-account.html)
or [REST API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids).

> **NOTE**: Users that have the __Modify Account__ permission can delete
> external ids that belong to other accounts. External ids in the `username`
> scheme can only be deleted by users that have __Administrate Server__
> or both `Maintain Server` and `Modify Account`. See the
> [documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids)
> for further details.

### Copy labels to new patch-sets

Gerrit matches patch set approvals against the provided query
string and, if the query matches, the approval is copied from one patch set
to the next.

The copy label feature is controlled by the
[`label.Label-Name.copyCondition`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-labels.html#label_copyCondition)
in `project.config`.

### New change predicates

It is possible to search for changes by uploader, using the new
[`uploader` and `uploaderin`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#uploader)
predicates.

Hashtags search is improved with the [`inhashtag`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#inhashtag)
predicate which returns all the changes where any hashtag contains a substring,
using a full-text search.

It is now possible to use the new
[`has:attention` and `is:attention` predicates](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#has-attention)
to search for changes having the attention of the current user.

Cherry-picked changes can now be searched using the
[`is:cherrypick`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#cherrypick)
predicate.

The special ["non_uploader" parameter](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#labels)
is now available as parameter for change predicates and matches any
user who's not the uploader of the latest patchset.

### Performance improvements on the change screen

The change screen has been improved by enabling extra caching and disabling
some expensive computation.

A new [`approvals` cache](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#cache_names)
contains approvals for a given patch set.

The new [`change.conflictsPredicateEnabled`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#change.conflictsPredicateEnabled)
setting in `gerrit.config` disables the computation of the conflicts section
avoiding a computation of complexity of O(nË†2), where n is the number of open
changes for the project the change belongs to.
When set to false the GUI will leave the conflict changes section on change
screen empty.

## Important notes

### Support for Java 8 dropped

The Java language level is now set to Java 11 for Gerrit, the support
for Java 8 is dropped.

Gerrit source code may not be compatible with Java 8 anymore.

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes.

The `changes` index version has been increased to version 71. By default the
index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup after the
upgrade.

To run offline reindexing of the changes (optional when upgrading from v3.3.x
or later):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit v3.5.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.3.x or v3.4.x when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.3.x or v3.4.x in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.5.x and start
   Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
6. Repeat steps 2. to 5. for all the other Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.3.x or v3.4.x release is possible, but requires the
following manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit v3.5.x servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.3.x or v3.4.x version
3. Run offline reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version
3. Startup Gerrit server

> **NOTE**: Downgrading is not always possible in Gerrit and is subject to
> specific restrictions on different releases. Always read the release notes
> carefully and look for the supported downgrade paths.

### Breaking changes

* The support for [ElasticSearch index](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/config-gerrit.html#elasticsearch)
  is removed from Gerrit core. Existing setups can still use ElasticSearch through
  external non-core libModules.

* The "Reply" button label and tooltip cannot be customized anymore: the
  `change.replyLabel` and `change.replyTooltip` are ignored.

* The `repo_download` [`download.scheme`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#download.scheme)
  is renamed to `repo`.

* The `bower` Bazel rules are removed: all front-end plugins would have to
  migrate to `yarn`.

* REST APIs with incompatible changes

  * [`AccountExternalIdInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#account-external-id-info)
    `email` field is renamed to `email_address`.

  * The `/accounts/link:#account-id[\{account-id\}]/stars.changes` endpoint
    is removed. Looking for starred changes is still available through the use
    of `is:starred` or `has:star` predicates.

### Other changes

* Request tracing can exclude URI patterns, using the
  [`tracing.traceid.excludedRequestUriPattern`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#tracing.traceid.requestUriPattern)
  setting in `gerrit.config`.

* Git receive-pack can have a grace-period configurable as
[`receive.cancellationTimeout` setting](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#receive.cancellationTimeout)
  for terminating after having received the cancellation signal from the client.

* Attention-set rules can be disabled upon push, using the
  [`--ignore-automatic-attention-set-rules` or `%ias` option](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-upload.html#ignore-attention-set).
