## Release highlights

### Case-insensitive username

Users can login with mixed case usernames without the risk to create
duplicate accounts.

The change affects the following external ids:
* `gerrit`   (LDAP)
* `username` (authentication REST and git endpoints)

For a new Gerrit setup, usernames are case insensitive by default, while for
existing installations the Gerrit admin can switch the functionality on/off
using the [`auth.userNameCaseInsensitive`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#auth.userNameCaseInsensitive)
setting in `gerrit.config`.

## Important notes

### Support for Java 8 dropped

The java language level is now set to Java 11 for Gerrit, the support
for Java 8 is dropped.

Gerrit source code may not be compatible with Java 8 anymore.

### Schema changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes since Gerrit v3.3.x, which means
that you can potentially upgrade directly skipping v3.4.x.

The changes index version has been increased to version 71. By default the changes
index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup after the upgrade.

To run off-line reindexing of the changes (optional):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.3.x or v3.4.x when configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit operation
on the GUI or using the Git protocol.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers upgraded to v3.3.x or v3.4.x in high-availability configuration,
   healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.5.x and start Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
6. Repeat steps 2. to 5. for all the secondary Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.3.x or v3.4.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.5.x servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.3.x or v3.4.x version
3. Run off-line reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version
3. Startup Gerrit server
