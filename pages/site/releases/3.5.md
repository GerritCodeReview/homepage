## Release highlights

### Case-insensitive usernames

Users can login with mixed case usernames without the risk to create
duplicate accounts.

The change affects the following external ids:
* `gerrit`   (LDAP)
* `username` (login, authenticated REST and git endpoints)

For a new Gerrit setup, usernames are case insensitive by default, while for
existing installations the Gerrit admin can switch the functionality on/off
using the [`auth.userNameCaseInsensitive`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#auth.userNameCaseInsensitive)
setting in `gerrit.config`.

> **NOTE**: In the All-Users.git repository, the SHA-1 sum of the account
> is computed preserving the case of the external ID. See the full details
> in the [Gerrit config accounts documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-accounts.html#external-ids). Existing accounts can be migrated to
> the new SHA-1 sum using the
> [offline](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/pgm-ChangeExternalIdCaseSensitivity.html)
> or [online](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/externalid-case-insensitivity.html#online-migration) migration tool.

### Request cancellation and execution deadlines

To limit the maximal execution time for requests, administrators can configure
server-side deadlines. More details are available in the
[Gerrit documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-request-cancellation-and-deadlines.html).

Any operation in Gerrit can now be subject to a configurable deadline, using
the [`deadline`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#deadline.id)
section in `gerrit.config`.

> **NOTE**: Deadlines are supported for `REST`, `SSH` and `GIT_RECEIVE`
> requests, but not for `GIT_UPLOAD` requests.

Gerrit commands can define an execution deadline, so that the processing
triggered on the server would be able to end in a definite time, even in case
of network interruption of the connection with the client.

### Removal of external ids

Gerrit external ids, including the username, can now be removed using the
[SSH command](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/cmd-set-account.html)
or [REST API](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids).

> **NOTE**: Users that have the __Modify Account__ permission can delete
> external ids that belong to other accounts. External ids in the `username`
> scheme can only be deleted by users that have __Administrate Server__
> or both `Maintain Server` and `Modify Account`. See the
> [documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#delete-account-external-ids)
> for further details.

### Copy labels to new patch-sets

Gerrit matches patch set approvals against the provided query
string and, if the query matches, the approval is copied from one patch set
to the next.

The copy label feature is controlled by the
[`label.Label-Name.copyCondition`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-labels.html#label_copyCondition)
in `project.config`.

### New change predicates

It is possible to search for changes by uploader, using the new
[`uploader` and `uploaderin`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#uploader)
predicates.

Hashtags search is improved with the [`inhashtag`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#inhashtag)
predicate which returns all the changes where any hashtag contains a substring,
using a full-text search.

It is now possible to use the new
[`has:attention` and `is:attention` predicates](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#has-attention)
to search for changes having the attention of the current user.

Cherry-picked changes can now be searched using the
[`is:cherrypick`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#cherrypick)
predicate.

The special ["non_uploader" parameter](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-search.html#labels)
is now available as parameter for change predicates and matches any
user who's not the uploader of the latest patchset.

### Performance improvements on the change screen

The change screen has been improved by enabling extra caching and disabling
some expensive computation.

A new [`approvals` cache](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#cache_names)
contains approvals for a given patch set.

The new [`change.conflictsPredicateEnabled`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#change.conflictsPredicateEnabled)
setting in `gerrit.config` disables the computation of the conflicts section
avoiding a computation of complexity of O(nË†2), where n is the number of open
changes for the project the change belongs to.
When set to false the GUI will leave the conflict changes section on change
screen empty.

## Important notes

### Support for Java 8 dropped

The Java language level is now set to Java 11 for Gerrit, the support
for Java 8 is dropped.

Gerrit source code may not be compatible with Java 8 anymore.

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes.

The `changes` index version has been increased to version 71. By default the
index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup after the
upgrade.

To run offline reindexing of the changes (optional when upgrading from v3.3.x
or later):

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit v3.5.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.2.x or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.2.x or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.5.x and start
   Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
6. Repeat steps 2. to 5. for all the other Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.3.x or v3.4.x release is possible, but requires the
following manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit v3.5.x servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.3.x or v3.4.x version
3. Run offline reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version
3. Startup Gerrit server

> **NOTE**: Downgrading is not always possible in Gerrit and is subject to
> specific restrictions on different releases. Always read the release notes
> carefully and look for the supported downgrade paths.

### Breaking changes

* The support for [ElasticSearch index](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.4.1/config-gerrit.html#elasticsearch)
  is removed from Gerrit core. Existing setups can still use ElasticSearch through
  external non-core libModules.

* The "Reply" button label and tooltip cannot be customized anymore: the
  `change.replyLabel` and `change.replyTooltip` are ignored.

* The `repo_download` [`download.scheme`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#download.scheme)
  is renamed to `repo`.

* The `bower` Bazel rules are removed: all front-end plugins would have to
  migrate to `yarn`.

* REST APIs with incompatible changes

  * [`AccountExternalIdInfo`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/rest-api-accounts.html#account-external-id-info)
    `email` field is renamed to `email_address`.

  * The `/accounts/{account-id}/stars.changes` endpoint
    is removed. Looking for starred changes is still available through the use
    of `is:starred` or `has:star` predicates.

* [Change 323855](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/323855) [Change 324115](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/324115):
ProjectCache#evict no longer triggers a reindex.

  During offline project reindexing evict() was triggering a duplicate reindex
  on the project when we only wanted to evict the project cache entry. This same
  issue occurred with the HA plugin and could be/been present in other plugins.

  If you have relied on a reindex being done on evict() you need to use
  evictAndReindex() instead. This behavior is now consistent with other evict()
  methods in Gerrit.

### Other changes

* Request tracing can exclude URI patterns, using the
  [`tracing.traceid.excludedRequestUriPattern`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#tracing.traceid.requestUriPattern)
  setting in `gerrit.config`.

* Git receive-pack can have a grace-period configurable as
[`receive.cancellationTimeout` setting](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/config-gerrit.html#receive.cancellationTimeout)
  for terminating after having received the cancellation signal from the client.

* Attention-set rules can be disabled upon push, using the
  [`--ignore-automatic-attention-set-rules` or `%ias` option](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.5.0/user-upload.html#ignore-attention-set).

## Bugfix releases

### 3.5.3 (In Development)

* Breaking changes

  * [Issue 15941](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15941)
  Fix SSH queries to not show commit-message unless --commit-message is provided
    This issue has existed for several years and should be considered
    breaking as users might expect commit message to be included by
    default in SSH query results.

    Obtaining the commit message is a costly operation as the commit
    data has to be loaded. So, showing it even when --commit-message
    is not provided degrades the performance of SSH queries.

* Performance Fixes

  * [Change 338614](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338614)
  Optimize SSH queries to avoid loading individual accounts
    This improves performance of SSH queries.

  Cache ProjectControl instances in SSH queries
    A PerThreadCache is used to cache ProjectControl instances to
    improve SSH query performance.

  * [Change 338474](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338474)
  Allow async receive-commits to have a thread-local cache
    Improve caching when merging changes through git push

### 3.5.1

* Security Fixes

  * [Change 333304](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/333304):
  Ignore `--no-limit` query changes option for anonymous users

    Prevent the use of `no-limit` option with query changes REST API.
    The option can result in excessive resources usage make Gerrit subject
    to DoS and DDoS by any remote endpoint without the need to have any
    Gerrit account or signing in.

* Docker Images

  * [Change 329639](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/329639):
  CentOS 8 AppStream has disappeared: use AlmaLinux 8.5 as replacement for Gerrit image

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 14945](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14945):
  Account cache is not caching the access to the account data refs

    Account cache in Gerrit v3.5 does not cache the access to the All-Users.git
    repository because of the refactoring of the cache key, which requires lookup
    of the All-Users.git refs. Gerrit allows now the refs in-memory caching using
    the [cached-refs](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/modules/cached-refdb) libModule.

    wasn't possible before. Allow to use multi-base git repositories with the
    [multi-site](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/multi-site/) plugin and the

  * [Issue 15531](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15531):
  Disable performance metrics by default.

    Performance metrics were introduced in 3.5.
    This caused, for example when upgrading from 3.4 to 3.5,
    a 10X increase of metrics, from thousands to tens of thousands.

    Disabling it by default to avoid an unexpected 10X increase
    of metrics payload, which could lead to an increase of latency
    when returning it.

  Restore transition support for cache-automerge refs which point to a tree

    Versions of Gerrit older than v2.13 may have cache-automerge refs
