## Release Highlights
* [Issue 2065](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=2065):
The new change screen is now the default change screen.

  The [documentation of the new review UI](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.9/user-review-ui.html)
  describes the new screens in detail and highlights the important functionality with
  screenshots.

  Users that are accessing the new change screen for the first time are informed about
  the new change screen by a welcome popup. The welcome popup links to the review UI
  documentation and allows users to go back to the old change screen.

* For full details please refer to the [release notes on the old site](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes-2.9.html).

## Bugfix Releases

### 2.9.5

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262):
Upgrade JGit to 4.5.5.201812240535-r

  This release fixes an issue where AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for
  `git-upload-pack` in protocol v0 bidirectional transports, meaning that
  wants aren't validated and a user can fetch anything that is pointed
  to by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1), as long as they can guess the
  object name.

* Fix resource exhaustion due to unclosed LDAP connection.

  When `auth.type` is set to `LDAP` (not `LDAP_BIND`), two LDAP connections
  are made, but one was not being closed. This eventually caused resource
  exhaustion and LDAP authentications failed.
