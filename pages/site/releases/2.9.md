## Bugfix Releases

### 2.9.5

* [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262):
Fix validation of `wants` in `git-upload-pack` for protocol v0 bidirectional transports.

  See the following section for details.

* Upgrade JGit to 4.5.5.201812240535-r.

  This upgrade includes several major versions since 3.4.2 used in Gerrit
  version 2.9.4. Important fixes are summarized below. Please refer to the
  corresponding JGit release notes for full details.

  * [JGit 4.5.5](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.5.5):

    * [Issue 10262](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=10262):
    Fix validation of `wants` in `git-upload-pack` for protocol v0 bidirectional transports.

      AdvertiseRefsHook was not called for `git-upload-pack` in protocol v0
      bidirectional transports, meaning that `wants` were not validated and
      a user could fetch anything that is pointed to by any ref (using fetch-by-sha1),
      as long as they could guess the object name.

  * [JGit 4.5.4](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.5.4):

    * Fix LockFile semantics when running on NFS.
    * Honor trustFolderStats also when reading packed-refs.

  * [JGit 4.5.3](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.5.3):

    * Fix exception handling for opening bitmap index files.

  * [JGit 4.5.2](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.5.2):

    * Fix pack marked as corrupted even if it isn't.

  * [JGit 4.5.1](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.5.2):

    * Don't remove Pack when FileNotFoundException is transient.

  * [JGit 4.1.0](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/4.1.0):

    * Handle stale NFS file handles on packed-refs file.
    * Use java.io.File instead of NIO to check existence of loose objects in
    ObjectDirectory to speed up inserting of loose objects.
    * Reduce memory consumption when creating bitmaps during writing pack files.

  * [JGit 3.7.1](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/3.7.1):

    * Fix massive performance problem in Gerrit caused by ObjectWalk.markUninteresting
    marking the root tree as uninteresting.

  * [JGit 3.7.0](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/3.7.0):

    * Provide more details in exceptions thrown when packfile is invalid.

  * [JGit 3.6.2](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/3.6.2):

    * [Issue 3094](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id=3094):
    Don't remove pack from pack list for problems which could be transient.

    * Log reason for ignoring pack when IOException occurred.

  * [JGit 3.5.3](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jgit/releases/3.5.3):

    * Fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-9390.

* Fix resource exhaustion due to unclosed LDAP connection.

  When `auth.type` is set to `LDAP` (not `LDAP_BIND`), two LDAP connections
  are made, but one was not being closed. This eventually caused resource
  exhaustion and LDAP authentications failed.
