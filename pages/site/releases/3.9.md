## Release highlights

### Java 17

The language level used for Gerrit source code stays on Java 11, however, Gerrit
is built and distributed for Java 17, which is the recommended JVM version for
running it in production.

### New stream events

**batch-refupdate**

Gerrit notifies all the refs of a single batch-refupdate as a single stream
event JSON payload [Issue 40015567](https://crbug.com/gerrit/40015567). The new
`batch-ref-updated` event is controlled by configuration and can be switched off
for backward compatibility with legacy CI/CD systems.

**ref-update** for draft-comments

Gerrit generates the ref-update event for all the additions and removals of
draft comments in the `All-Users`
project ([Change 382819](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/382819)). This
is needed for replicating the
`All-Users` project across sites, thanks to the replication plugins being
notified of the updates.

Due to the nature of drafts, on busy installations the amount of `ref-updated`
events created on draft operations could be high, possibly having an impact on
performance.

For this reason this is disabled by default, you can enable it by
configuring `event.stream-events.enableDraftCommentEvents=true`
in `gerrit.config` [Change 385714](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/385714)

### New limits

There are new limit definitions which can be used to protect Gerrit from
improper client activity.

- `change.topicLimit`: defines the maximum number of changes in the same
  topic ([Change 381055](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/381055).

- `change.maxFileSizeDownload`: prevents memory overload caused by clients
  downloading large files from
  REST-API ([Change 381595](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/381595)).

- `change.maxFileSizeDiff`: prevents memory overload caused by rendering large
  files diffs in a browser.

### New diff3 view

A new `change.diff3ConflictView` option allows to enable a richer diff3
rendering of changes with conflict
markers ([Change 382894](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/382894)).

### Attention-set improvements

Gerrit can return changes to the original attention set assignment if any of the
new assignees do not provide feedback within a specific
time ([Issue 40015204](https://crbug.com/gerrit/40015204)). The behaviour is
controlled by two new settings, `attentionSet.readdAfter`
and `attentionSet.readdMessage`.

### Indexing improvements

Allow to limit the queries that do not specify a default limit and also can now
reindex changes with an asynchronous process when a change is updated from the
UI, controlled by the `index.indexChangesAsync`.

The new option yields a much more responsive user-experience by releasing UI
elements without waiting for the backend reindex execution to complete.

### Account deletion

Users can now delete their own account, making it possible to be forgotten by
the Gerrit Code Review platform. Please note that existing commits in the
projects will stay and the account's e-mail stored in Git commits will be
preserved beyond account deletion.

### User Suggested Edits

[User Suggested Edits](http://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.9.1/user-suggest-edits.html)
are an easy and fast way for reviewers to suggest code changes that can be
easily applied by the change owner. They were introduced in `3.7.2` as an
experimental feature, disabled by default. With Gerrit `3.9`, this feature
is no longer experimental and _User Suggested Edits_ are now enabled by default.

### Plugin development

#### Custom key/value pairs stored in NoteDb

Plugins may store additional string key/value pairs to change notes in NoteDb.

[Change 372694](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/372694) Added APIs to
set/get custom keyed-value change metadata

#### Cross-plugin communication and dependency

Plugins can communicate and declare dependencies to other plugins thanks to the
introduction of
[`Gerrit-ApiModule`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.9.0/dev-plugins.html#_cross_plugin_communication)
Guice modules in plugin
manifest ([Issue 292114807](https://crbug.com/gerrit/292114807)).

#### Lookup changes by change number

[Change 394440](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/394440) flagged the API Changes.id(int) as deprecated
to prevent using it from plugins and fail to locate changes imported from Gerrit servers with a different server-id.

## Important notes

### Upgrade from Gerrit v3.9.0 (defective release)

The release of Gerrit v3.9.0 has been impacted by the bad merge of
[Change 394445](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/394445)
due to the ["implicit merge on moved changes issue"](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40009784)
that has pulled 64 unwanted commits from the master branch.
As a consequence, the version has been declared defective and withdrawn.

The upgrade from 3.9.0 to the following 3.9.\* patch-releases needs to
follow the instructions of the _"Offline upgrade"_ because it contains an
incompatible Lucene Engine that won't be able to read the legacy index data.

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes.

The `accounts` index version has been increased to version _13_.
The `changes` index version has been increased to version _84_.
The `groups` index version has been increased to version _10_.
The `projects` index version has been increased to version _8_.

### Online index schema upgrade from 3.7/3.8

By default, if you're upgrading from 3.7/3.8, the index is automatically rebuilt
upon Gerrit startup after the upgrade.

If you're upgrading from 3.6 or an earlier version, you must use the Offline
upgrade steps below.

### Offline upgrade

1. Download the new gerrit.war
2. Stop Gerrit
3. Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
4. Run init
   ```sh
    java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
   ```
5. Reindex
  * If you are upgrading from a 3.7/3.8 versions you don't need to run reindex
     (see `Online index schema upgrade from 3.7/3.8` above). If you still want
     to you will need to run reindex:
     ```sh
        java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
     ```
  * If you are upgrading from a 3.6 or an earlier version, you must run a
     reindex of all indexes:
     ```sh
        java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
     ```
     See
     the [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.9.0/pgm-reindex.html)
     program for other options.
6. Start Gerrit

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.9.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.7 or later when
configured using
a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
, and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.7 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both
   Gerrit primaries.
3. Set one of the Gerrit servers to unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.9.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both
   Gerrit primaries.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.7/v3.8 release is possible, but requires the following
manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.7/v3.8 version
3. Run offline change reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version
   ```sh
     java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
     java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
   ```
4. Startup Gerrit server

### Native packaging

### Known issues

* [Issue 380898784](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/380898784):
The new `changes_by_project` cache will make the `git-upload-pack` fail intermittently
on projects containing one or more inconsistent changes.

  The introduction of the `changes_by_project` cache is incompatible with projects
  having one or more inconsistent changes, like the ones changes `/meta` refs coming
  from other Gerrit `serverId`. The cache makes the `git-upload-pack` failing intermittently
  with internal server errors when it fails to load the change meta-data and depending
  on the status of the cache.
  As a workaround, disable the `changes_by_project` cache as follows in `gerrit.config`:
  ```
  [cache "changes_by_project"]
        memoryLimit = 0
  ```

### Breaking changes

* [Change 369234](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/369234)
Return 400 BAD_REQUEST when a reviewer cannot be added by email

  When trying to add a user that cannot be added as a reviewer on a change, the
  API was returning a 200 Status Code with an error message.

* [Change 379475](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/379475)
  Don't call Java gc explicitly, remove --gc option from show-caches ssh command
  and REST API /config/server/summary

* [Change 378638](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/378638)
Remove `change.stars` field from `ChangeInfo`

  Remove the `stars` field from the `ChangeInfo` response. You should check
  whether you were relying on this field when using any REST endpoint returning
  `ChangeInfo`.

* [Change 373780](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/373780)
  removed all `performance/operations/*` metrics because of the performance
  issues introduced ([details](https://crbug.com/gerrit/40014513))

* [Change 371198](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/371198)
Add option to populate 'starred' field for change queries

  `star` option can must now be provided to include the `starred` field in
  `ChangeInfo`, which indicates if the change is starred by the current user or
  not.

* [Change 387435](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/387435)
`refreshAfterWrite` and `maxAge` settings in gerrit config are now honored for
  both persistent and in-memory caches.

  Previously these settings were erroneously ignored for persistent caches. If
  you rely on them for persistent caches you should be aware they will be
  honoured now.

* [Change 379154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/379154)
New patch sets will prefer the previous patch set's committer email

  If one of the user's secondary emails was used as the committer email in
  previous patchset, continue using it instead of preferred email.

* [Change 390986](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/390986)
Update `mockito` to `5.6.0` and `bytebuddy` to `1.14.9`

  Mockito framework was upgraded from `3.3.3` to `5.6.0`, hence if you have some
  custom plugins your test code might require some minor refactoring. Please
  refer to the mockito [documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/5.6.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html)
  and the [release notes](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/compare/v3.3.3...v5.6.0)

Support tracing requests that match a header

  Gerrit supports tracing requests that match a configured trace configuration.
  With this change we add a new parameter to the tracing configuration that
  allows matching requests by a header. E.g. this allows matching requests that
  are sent with a certain user agent (e.g. headerPattern = User-Agent=foo-.\*).

* [Change 392518](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/392518)
Change `.scl` files to be highlighted as python

* [Change 392175](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/392175)
  Reviewer's votes are not restored back after the reviewer is deleted and added
  back

  When a reviewer votes for the patchset and then the reviewer is removed,
  Gerrit removes votes from this reviewer too. However if the reviewer is added
  back (to the same patchset) previous votes are restored back.

  This change ensures that after a reviewer is deleted, all votes from this
  reviewer are permanently removed.

* [Change 390897](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/390897)
Option to skip projects during change reindexing

  Introduce `index.excludeProjectFromChangeReindex`: A list of projects that

Account external IDs are updated in a single commit

* [Change 390919](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/390919)
Skip already reindexed changes during reindexing

  During online reindexing after an upgrade, all changes were reindexed, even if
  they were already present in the new index. If the Gerrit instance was
  restarted before the index was ready, this caused a lot of repeated indexing.

  Now, changes that are already present in the newest index version won't be
  reindexed anymore. However, they will still be checked for staleness and
  reindexed if necessary.

* [Change 376094](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/376094)
Add cache to speedup ref advertisements (particularly on replicas) and
  receive-pack

    users.

    key.

### 3.9.3 (Withdrawn)

### 3.9.2

* Breaking changes

  * [Change 404018](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/404018):
  Add option to populate 'starred' field for change queries.

    A `star` option must now be provided to include the `starred` field in
    `ChangeInfo`, which indicates if the change is starred by the current user or
    not.

* New Features

  * [Change 406237](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/406237):
  Add metrics for `git/upload-pack/bitmap_index_misses_count` and a separate one for
  missing bitmap indexes.

    JGit packer tracks the number of times that an object was not
    found in the bitmap index or if the bitmap index was completely
    missing.
    Added the `git/upload-pack/bitmap_index_misses_count` for being used
    in performance graphs, while the `git/upload-pack/no_bitmap_index`
    should be more suitable for alerts.

  * [Change 406004](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/406004):
  Add timer for git/upload-pack/phase_searching_for_* phases.

    Add metrics for the "Finding sources" phase, which is critical for an optimal
    Git/HTTP performance.

  * [Change 402497](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/402497):
  Introduce configurable shutdown timeout

    Added `container.shutdownTimeout` to configure the maximum time (in seconds)
    to wait before terminating Gerrit.

  * [Change 404718](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/404718):
  Add timer for `git/upload-pack/phase_negotiating`.

    Added the `git/upload-pack/phase_negotiating` so that the Gerrit admin
    can graph how these are performing and spot any potential issues.
    JGit packer tracks time spent in the negotiation phase.
    This statistic was only exposed in the sshd_log and is not available
    when the client uses Git/HTTP.

  * [Change 393037](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/393037):
  Bazel: Add support for BuildBuddy RBE provider.

    BuildBuddy provides an open-core suite of enterprise features for Bazel.

* Performance Fixes

  * [Change 392634](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/392634):

  checks when submit type is `Merge-If-Necessary`.

* Bug Fixes

   * [Issue 325537222](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/325537222)

   Fix x-plugin communication with multiple ApiModules

    Fixes plugin load failure when multiple plugins were declaring ApiModules for cross
    communication.

   * [Change 395016](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/395016)
   Fixed NPE when submitting changes.

    Fixes potential NullPointerException when `ignoreSelfApproval` magic label is used.

  * [Issue 314113030](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/314113030):
  Fail the change reindex operation upon StorageException(s).

    Allows some of the indexing operations to fail, so that if a change indexing
    throws a `StorageException`, so that the change does not disappear
    from the index.

  * [Change 395741](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/395741):
  Fix event parse exception when changing repository HEAD.

    Explicitly registered a type and class for `ProjectHeadUpdatedEvent` in `EventType`
    in order to successfully deserialize events.

  * [Issue 318745940](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/318745940):
  Fix serverId in identity parsing for imported human comments.

    Remapping of account-ids correctly adapts the comment's author account-ids
    and `serverId` fixing the inconsistent identity of the comments.

  * [Change 400997](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/400997)
  Reduce email spam, by not notifying existing reviewers when new ones are added

  Fixed WIP changes always showing Merge Conflict in searches

    Fixes the work-in-progress changes always shown as having a merge conflict when
    `change.mergeabilityComputationBehaviour` was set to value other than `NEVER`.

  * [Issue 312895375](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/312895375)
  Fix comment directly link pointing to a change imported from other Gerrit
  server-ids

    Fixes direct links to a comment on a change imported from another Gerrit instance returning
    HTTP status 404.

  * [Change 404937](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/404937):
  Fix copyable change links when base URL has a path.

    Removed extra base URL prefix in `gr-copy-links`. The links are crafted from
    createChangeUrl which already returns an URL with the base URL.

  * [Issue 311925527](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/311925527):
  Fix canonical web url binding in Git over HTTP.

    Fix a problem encountered in the `virtualhost` plugin, where
    despite proper configuration for tenant canonical web URL, the git push
    output would use the value of `gerrit.canonicalWebUrl` configuration option.
