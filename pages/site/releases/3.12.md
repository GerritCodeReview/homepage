## Release highlights

### Java 21

The language level used for Gerrit source code is set to Java 21, matching its distributed code level
since [Gerrit v3.11](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.11.html#java-21).

It is now mandatory to migrate the Java Virtual Machine to Java 21 and there is no possibility to
rebuild Gerrit source code with Java 17 anymore. Also, all the non-core plugins need to be rebuilt
and verified with Java 21; existing Java 17 plugins may not load or work properly.

### Gitattributes configuration support in JGit merge driver

Gerrit support now the gitattributes with merge driver configuration, introduced in
[Change 441721](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/441721).

When Gerrit performs server-side merges, it supports now the reading
and processing of the [gitattributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes.html#_built_in_merge_drivers)
reading the global, repo, and in-tree gitattributes files.

The support of gitattributes is implemented for the built-in `binary`
and `union` merge drivers.

### Allow global site-wide override for label's copyCondition

There are two new config variables introduced with [Change 446062](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/446062):

- `label.<name>.labelCopyEnforcement`
  for enforcing an additional copy condition for all labels on all projects

- `label.<name>.labelCopyRestriction`
  for reducing forcibly any copy condition for all labels on all projects

When the two settings are defined in `gerrit.config`, then for every project, the final
copyCondition is equivalent to `(<labelCondition> AND NOT <copyRestriction>) OR <copyEnforcement>`

This new behaviour is covered by the experiment feature flag
`GerritBackendFeature__enable_central_override_for_code_review_copy_condition`.

Example of `labelCopyEnforcement` is making sure all negative votes are copied; similarly
`labelCopyRestriction` could be used for making sure only trusted contributors are allowed to submit
changes without reviewers re-confirming that their comments have been addressed.

### Introduce the group deletion functionality

It is possible to allow users to delete groups through a new `deleteGroup` global capability.
All the users and groups with the new capability, will have access to the delete group button and the
associated backend REST-API that allow to remove Gerrit groups.

In order for a group to be deleted, there are some prerequisites that need to be satisfied:

- The given group is not a system group
- The given group is an internal group (it is assumed that we will not
  allow to delete external groups)
- The given group is not the owner of any other group(s)
- The given group is not used in any ref permissions for any projects

### New H2 v2 storage backend for persistent caches

The H2 library is upgraded to v2 which provides fully multi-threaded operations
and a lower memory footprint, as presented in the [GerritMeets of March 2025](https://youtu.be/T2ApofhyF10?feature=shared).
Migrating from H2 to H2 v2 requires either the rebuild of the persistent caches
from scratch or the execution of a [migration tool](https://github.com/manticore-projects/H2MigrationTool)
to translate the legacy cache files to the new format.

## Contributors

Gerrit 3.12 has had a total of 55 contributors, of which 7 first-time contributors:
- Fredde Ribeiro
- Jade Lovelace
- John Soo
- Pavel Valodzka
- Tran Tuan Khai Phan
- Zhechen Yan
- Narendra Kumar

## Important Notes

### Schema and index changes

Gerrit schema version is unchanged; however, because of the Lucene library bump
to 10.1.0, the on-line upgrade is possible only from Gerrit v3.11 and not from
earlier releases.

All the indexes versions have been increased therefore requiring a reindex:
- `accounts` index version updated to `15`.
- `changes` index version updated to `87`.
- `groups` index version updated to `12`.
- `projects` index version updated to `10`.

### Offline upgrade

- Download the new `gerrit.war`
- Stop Gerrit
- Backup the existing indexes in case a rollback is required
- Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
- Run init `java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch`
- Reindex all indexes:

  `java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path`

  See the
  [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.12.0/pgm-reindex.html)
  command for other options.

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.12.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.11 when configured
using either
[high-availability](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
or
[multi-site](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/multi-site/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
setup.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users will not experience any
outage or service disruption and will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation seamlessly.

The zero-downtime upgrade process for high-availability or multi-site setups
consists of the following steps ([demo](https://youtu.be/vK5qsb0W7q4)):

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.11 in high-availability or multi-site
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set one of the Gerrit servers to unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war, plugins and libs to v3.12.x and start Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Ensure the Gerrit server is fully caught up with the events that happened while
   it was down before directing traffic to it.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each of the remaining Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to Gerrit v3.11 release is possible, but requires the following
manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.11 version
3. Init Gerrit

  ```sh
    java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
  ```

### Native packaging

The GPG keys for GerritForge's distribution site have changed and need to be reimported
before the upgrade.

- On Debian / Ubuntu):
  `apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 55787ed781304950`

- on AlmaLinux / RedHat / Fedora:
  `rpm --import 'https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x72adb205736d7147da56e8c955787ed781304950â€™`

The Docker-based distributions have been updated:

- AlmaLinux bumped to 9.5

- Ubuntu bumped to Eclipse Temurin 21.0.6_7 (24.04.1 LTS)

## Security Fixes

* [Change 435337](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435337)
  REST API responses are now rendered in the browser rather than downloaded, with XSS protection
  and blocking the use in i-frame.

### Known issues

* [Issue 309098227](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/309098227)
  [Change 360646](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360646):
The introduction of a per-request ref cache for better performance may break
the repository consistency

  The addition of a new `core.usePerRequestRefCache` setting, true by
  default, introduced a per request (currently per request thread) ref
  cache, helping reduce the overhead of checking if the packed-refs file
  was outdated. However, in some scenarios, such as multi-site or
  concurrency between `git-receive-pack` and `git-gc`, it may lead to
  split-brain inconsistencies and, in the worst-case scenario, to the
  corruption of the underlying repository.

### Breaking Changes

* [Change 447781](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447781)
  Disabled loading and executing 'rules.pl' by default.

  Prolog rules have been deprecated since Gerrit 3.6; they are now officially disabled
  by default. Gerrit administrators are required to inform all the project owners
  and convert the Prolog rules to Submit Requirements.

  > **NOTE**: It is still possible to enable the Prolog rules processing again with
  > `rules.enable = true` in `gerrit.config`, bearing in mind that the option may not be
  > available anymore in future versions of Gerrit, therefore should be used only
  > as temporary workaround during the migration from Prolog to Submit Requirements.


* [Change 440743](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/440743)
  Do not notify listeners when performing online reindexing.

  When performing online reindexing, the notification to listeners and consequent
  sending of the index-change messages in high-availability and multi-site scenarios
  was potentially causing unnecessary traffic and CPU utilisation during the
  schema index updates.

  > **NOTE**: If the reindexing is performed for refreshing outdated index records
  > the online reindexing commands would need to be executed against all the nodes
  > of the Gerrit cluster, as the missed listeners notifications would not trigger
  > the reindexing elsewhere.

* [Change 449321](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/449321)
  [Change 448244](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/448244)
  Set Verified label default function to NoBlock for new sites.

  Label functions are deprected and the submittability of changes needs to
  be encoded as Submit Requirements, therefore new Gerrit sites are encouraged
  to define their submittability rather than relying on the legacy label functions
  deprecated since Gerrit v3.6.

  > **NOTE**: Existing sites would not be impacted, unless they were relying on the
  > default label function; however, Gerrit project owners are invited to remove the
  > use of label functions and use Submit Requirements instead.

* [Change 451223](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/451223):
  Added a new MigrateLabelFunctions site program for helping with the migration from
  label functions to Submit Requirements.

* [Issue 390443239](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/390443239)
  Swap project-created/ref-updated in stream events upon project creation

  Gerrit always produced the project-created/ref-updated in the wrong order,
  generating the ref-update of inexistent projects just created. The order is
  now rectified; however, existing stream events consumers may rely on the
  previous incorrect ordering and potentially break.


* [Change 457802](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/457802):
  Users with the `Administrate Server` can see all changes, branches and tags, including
  private changes and `refs/meta/config`.

  Administrators own the Gerrit service and are responsible to investigate
  issues; allowing to access everything simplifies the troubleshooting, avoiding
  them to first assign permissions to themselves, investigate the issue and then
  remember to undo the permission changes.

  Also note that the `skip-visibility` option when querying changes is deprecated
  and effectively ignored. It will be removed in the next version of Gerrit.

  > **NOTE**: With this change, Gerrit would not allow anymore to separate the
  > roles of the security administration and the service management, therefore it
  > is highly recommended to carefully review all the users and groups with the
  > `Administrate Server`.

* [Change 435338](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435338):
  Patchsets are now downloaded as plain-text patch files using the ?raw parameter and
  not base64 or ziped.

### New Features

* [Change 442981](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442981):
  Allow restricting users from deleting their own accounts.

  Introduce `accounts.enableDelete` configuration for disabling the ability for users
  to remove themselves from the Gerrit Web-UI.

* [Change 445801](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/445801):
  Introduce `is:POSITIVE` and `is:NEGATIVE` as predicates for copyCondition on labels,
  allowing generic matching of any positive or negative reviews.

* [Change 447745](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447745)
  [Change 459463](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/459463)
  [Change 447749](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447749)
  [Change 447748](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447748)
  [Change 447746](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447746)
  Assign TRACE_ID for every request and include in all SSH and HTTP interactions.

  Allow to follow the TRACE_ID across all interactions and logs, including
  the sshd_log and httpd_log entries.

* [Change 444441](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/444441)
  Add `changeis` predicate as Copy-Condition expressions, with any predicate supported by
  `is:{predicate}`

* [Change 444962](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/444962)
  [Change 457801](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/457801):
  Add configuration for case-insensitive email matching in account resolution and API.

  Enable case-insensitive matching of the name part of e-mails on a per-domain basis,
  as configured in `accounts.caseInsensitiveLocalPart`.

* [Change 442021](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442021):
  Add `success_count` and `error_count` metrics for ssh requests.

* [Change 447841](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447841):
  Disallow addition of new rules.pl files in projects

  Adding a new `rules.allowNewRules = false` the Gerrit admin can reject
  the addition of new `rules.pl` files into the projects.

* [Change 456684](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/456684)
  [Change 456685](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/456685):
  Added draft comments cleanup REST-API and SSH command.

* [Change 456182](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/456182):
  Added draftsCleanup background job and automatic scheduled configuration.

* [Change 447629](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447629):
  Added support for adding the Project Owners group as a reviewer

* [Change 445362](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/445362):
  Added support for commit validators to return a status + metadata in addition to messages

* [Issue 317340200](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/317340200):
  Added support for creating a branch on an empty commit.

  Similar to creating a project with an empty commit, allow to create a branch
  not having any initial commit.

* [Issue 401141848](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/):
  Fix ref existance check when creating new refs

  Gerrit v3.6 introduced a [new check](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/287790)
  for verifying the existance of refs before crating new refs and avoiding misleading
  `LOCK_FAILURE` errors. The check was implemented using a `Repository.resolve()`
  API which would expand the ref name as it was a logical name resolution
  causing the inability to push some refs, like tags that use the
  _git describe_ in their names. The issue is fixed by using
  a proper refs finding and brings back the full refs creation functionality.

* [Change 439226](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/439226):
  The new configuration style, where index name is explicitly provided as
  subsection name.

* [Change 447221](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447221):
  Store/provide merge conflict information for revisions created by Gerrit

  For revisions that are created by Gerrit, we know whether conflicts are
  present and which commits were used as 'ours' and 'theirs' during the
  Git merge that created the conflicts. For those revisions we can store
  this information in NoteDb and make it available to callers in
  RevisionInfo.

* [Change 446721](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/446721):
  Provide index metric for accounts/changes/groups/projects

  Introduce four new Gauge metrics to track the number of documents
  in the respective search indexes:

  - indexes/accounts
  - indexes/changes
  - indexes/groups
  - indexes/projects

* [Change 447747](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447747):
  Include SSH session in the `error_log` entries

  The inclusion of the SSH session in the `error_log` allows to look for the errors
  associated with a specific session and trace, making it easier to troubleshoot
  problems.

* [Change 457722](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/457722):
  Allow SubmitRequirement atoms to return an explanation

* [Change 447776](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447776):
  Make "message:" predicate for SR consistent with search

### Performance improvements

* [Change 442022](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442022):
  Faster replica startup when group reindexing enabled by parallelizing reindexing of groups

* [Change 448182](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/448182):
  H2Cache BloomFilter will no longer degrade forever as it is rebuilt automatically after pruning
  if >= 25% invalidated

* [Change 447141](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447141):
  Reduce bulk action query result payload by not getting already available SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS data

* [Change 447344](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447344):
  The List Labels endpoint now supports filtering by voteable labels.

* [Issue 390453038](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/390453038):
  Configure the number of open changes' refs advertised on push to a repository for reducing CPU
  utilization and latency.

* [Change 449582](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/449582):
  Fix the reference counting for a correct release of repositories from the JGit in-memory
  repository cache.

  Previously the repositories were never released in the JGit in-memory cache, causing the overload
  of the JVM heap and consequent degradation of the performance due to the high CPU utilization
  caused by the continuous JVM GC.

* [Change 448181](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/448181):
  With H2 v2 caches are multi-threaded therefore can be set operational concurrently with the
  building of bloomFilters

### Bug fixes

* [Change 453981](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/453981):
  gc_log is no longer overwritten when rotated.

* [Change 449582](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/449582):
  Fix progress logging in MultiProgressMonitor, which had the unintended side effect to log the
  progress the receive commits operations

* [Change 464703](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/464703):
  Cancel diff tasks failing due to timeout or interrupted preventing them from consuming resources
  unnecessarily

* [Change 442424](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442424):
  Respect project config and user preference for creating changes as work-in-progress by default for
  the Revert REST endpoint

* [Change 447640](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447640)
  [Change 447639](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/447639):
  Reviewer suggestion for empty query: Fallback to project owners and reviewers of recent changes.

## Frontend changes

* [Change 449581](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/449581)
  Add HTTP request header to distinguish plugins from core.

  A new HTTP header `X-Gerrit-Request-Origin` added to the requests coming
  from the Gerrit Web-UI helps identify whether an API is invoked from `core-ui`
  or `plugin:<plugin-name>` for requests originated from plugins.

* [Change 464661](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/464661):
  Allow opening edit preference in editor view.

  Improved error message when trying to add a non-internal group as a reviewer

* [Change 460961](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/460961):
  Send revert notifications from user that created the revert rather than the
  user that has set the change as ready.

* [Change 458461](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/458461):
  The UI tooltop for submit requirement atoms will now show explanations if implemented by the
  underlying predicate
