## Release highlights

### Rebase on behalf of the uploader

Rebasing a change from the web UI preserves the uploader.

This has the advantage that the rebaser is not taking over the change, which is
important when the project is configured to ignore self-approvals of the
uploader, as this allows the reviewer to approve and submit the change, after
doing a rebase.

### Rebase a chain of changes

Allow to atomically rebase a chain of changes.

If the chain is outdated, i.e., there's a change that depends on an old revision
of its parent, the result is the same as individually rebasing all outdated
changes on top of their parent's latest revision.

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't contain schema changes.

The `changes` index version has been increased to version _82_.

### Online index schema upgrade from 3.7
By default, if you're upgrading from 3.7, the index is automatically
rebuilt upon Gerrit startup after the upgrade.

If you're upgrading from 3.6 or an earlier version, you must use the
Offline upgrade steps below.

### Offline upgrade

1. Download the new gerrit.war
2. Stop Gerrit
3. Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
4. Run init

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
```

4. Reindex

  * If you are upgrading from a 3.7 version you don't need to run reindex (see
    `Online index schema upgrade from 3.7` above). If you still want to you will
    only need to run reindex of `changes`:

      ```sh
      java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
      ```

   * If you are upgrading from a 3.6 version, or an earlier version, you must
     run a reindex of all indexes:

      ```sh
      java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
      ```

See
the [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.8.0/pgm-reindex.html)
program for other options.

5. Start Gerrit

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.8.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.7.2 or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.7.2 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit primaries.
3. Set one of the Gerrit servers to unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.8.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit primaries.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.7.x release is possible, but requires the
following manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit v3.8.x servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.7.x version
3. Run offline change reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

4. Startup Gerrit server

### Native packaging

* GerritForge RPM repository updated for arm64 architecture

  [GerritForge RPM v1.4](https://gerritforge.com/gerritforge-repo-1-4.noarch.rpm)
  has been released, including the native packages for arm64 architecture.

* [DockerHub images for arm64|amd64 architectures](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit/tags?page=1&name=3.8.0)
  * [gerrit:3.8.0-almalinux8](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit/tags?page=1&name=3.8.0-almalinux8)
    OS base image upgraded to [AlmaLinux 9.1](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/9.1.html)

  * [gerrit:3.8.0-ubuntu22](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit/tags?page=1&name=3.8.0-ubuntu22)
    OS base image upgraded to [Ubuntu 22](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668)

### Breaking changes
* [Change 365595](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/365595):
WebLinkInfo: Drop deprecated constructor

  Custom UI plugins that are explicitly using `WebLinkInfo` are affected by this
  and might need adapting.

* [Change 360756](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360756):
Disallow uploading new prolog rules files.

    Clients should use submit-requirements instead. Please note that
    modifications and deletions of existing rules.pl files are still
    allowed.

* [Change 360054](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360054):
Allow callers to format create change response

    Add `ListChangeOptions` to `ChangeInput` and `ApplyPatchPatchSetInput` such that
    callers can control what fields should be formatted in the returned ChangeInfo.
    For ApplyPatch, this commit changes the default formatting options from
    `CURRENT_COMMIT` to `no-options`.

* [Change 360219](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360219):
Delete vote now fails for an already deleted vote

  An e-mail was sent each time when a vote was executed, even if the label had
  been already set to 0 and thus no actual changes were made.

  This fix can break some scenarios, where the caller expects that DeleteVoteOp
  will always succeed after the label was added at least once. This should be
  fixed on the caller side.

* [Change 358975](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/358975):
Skip account visibility checks when querying changes

  Skipping the account visibility check when querying changes of users
  participating in the change (the change owner, reviewers, CCs etc.). This
  affects several search predicates: `owner` / `uploader` / `label`
  + `user` / `reviewer` / `attention`
    / `commentby`

* [Change 358954](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/358954):
Check permissions when resolving accounts by secondary emails

fixed an issue that allowed users to resolve secondary emails, although they
should not have been able to see them.

* [Change 358114](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/358114):
removed automatic linkification of URLs that do not start with `http://` or
  `https://`.

* [Change 357298](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357298):
Removed Assignee functionality in Gerrit.

  'Assignee' functionality has been superseded by 'Attention Set'. The
  functionality has no Web UI support anymore.

* [Change 357276](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357276):
Removed option to disable Attention Set

  No longer support the option of disabling the Attention Set.

* [Change 356941](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/356941):
Do not set `real_author` in ChangeMessageInfo if `author` == `real_author`

  It's not needed to return the author twice if the change message was not
  impersonated. Documentation already stated this, but clients should double check
  they don't rely on `real_author` always being returned.

* [Change 354916](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/354916):
Remove registerStyleModule() plugin API

  Use `plugin.styleApi().insertCSSRule()` instead.

* [Change 351814](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351814):
Remove `notify()` from AnnotationPluginApi

* [Change 351515](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351515):
Remove html commentlink functionality.

  Html commentlinks allow for arbitrary html injection on the page. Replaced
  them with link commentlinks, using optional `prefix`, `suffix`, `text`
  parameters to achieve the same functionality. Existing configs can be migrated
  using scripts in `tools/migration/html_to_link_commentlink.md`

  * [Change 353294](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/353294):
    Provide an option to skip replication of NoteDb meta refs

    Replicating NoteDb meta refs is not needed when the remote does not run a
    Gerrit instance. This can be now disabled
    via `remote.<NAME>.replicateNoteDbMetaRefs`

## Performance changes

* [Change 360646](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360646):
Introduce a per request ref cache for better performance

  Add a new `core.usePerRequestRefCache` setting. If the setting is true, use a
  per request (currently per request thread)
  ref cache. This helps reduce the overhead of checking if the packed-refs file
  is outdated. This setting is true by default.

* [Change 365144](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/365144):
Destination queries now use the change index

Privacy information on settings page

* [Change 354154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/354154):
Enter key selects emoji after ':' is typed

  The previous behavior was that enter wouldn't select emojis until more
  characters were typed after ':'.

* [Change 352682](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/352682):
Matching atoms in copy conditions that are posted as change messages are
  highlighted in bold now.

  When a new patch set is created and approvals are copied to the new patch set,

Removed all hardcoded gr-icons.

  All core plugins have been migrated to using Material-based gr-icon which no
  longer need these hardcoded SVGs.

## Documentation changes

Fixed rebasing chain when a checks refs exists for one of the changes

  Fixed a NPE that might have been thrown when rebasing on changes for which
  a `checks` ref exists.

* [Change 366334](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/366334)
Added 'a' as alias for the 'author' search operator

  This follows the example of other aliases, e.g. 'o' for 'owner' or 'r' for '
  reviewer'.

* [Change 365901](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/365901)
Added global capability that allows to view secondary emails

  If users have multiple emails only the preferred email is visible to other

  global capability it's possible to allow viewing all emails.

* [Change 361460](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/361460)
Allow editing commit message from Change-Id: to Link: footer

  This allows to edit the commit message by replacing a valid 'Change-Id:'
  footer for a valid 'Link:' footer.

* [Change 350455](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/350455):
Enables transition from LDAP to Google OAuth

  When transitions to Google OAuth from LDAP, if the account exists with the
  same e-mail then the account ID is reused. This allows to have the same user
  history post migration.

* [Change 359974](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/359974):
Fixed calculation of insertions and change buckets for change emails

  When computing change email, the number of files, insertions and deletions
  didn't count the commit message for number of files, but for insertions the
  lines from the commit message were counted, which was inconsistent.

* [Change 358115](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/358115):
Allow for plugin data directory to be symlinked

* [Change 357648](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357648):
Don't add owner to attention set on merged change if bot re-applies a negative vote

  Bots can no longer re-apply negative votes on merged change, leading to an
  unwanted attention set update.

* [Change 357477](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357477):
Added a new 'uploaderemail:<pattern>' operator for Submit Requirements

  returns true if the uploader's email matches a specific regular expression
  pattern.

* [Change 357474](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357474):
Added a new 'committeremail:<pattern>' operator for Submit Requirements

  returns true if the change committer's email matches a specific regular
  expression pattern.

* [Change 357460](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357460):
Fixed `ownerin/uploaderin` for internal groups that include external groups

  Fixed an issue where the `ownerin` and `uploaderin` predicates were not matching
  correctly for internal groups that include external groups.

* [Change 350034](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/350034):
The commit-msg hook respects the scissors marker for the empty message detection.

  When "git commit --cleanup=scissors" the commit-msg hook couldn't detect if
  the commit message is empty properly.

* [Change 357278](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357278):
Fixed parsing of URL parameters that contain a '%' that is not part of an encoded character

  Without this fix users could trigger 500 internal server errors in Gerrit by
  providing invalid strings for URL parameters.

* [Change 356762](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/356762):
Added support for rebasing on behalf of the uploader

  Rebasing a change on behalf of the uploader means that the uploader stays
  intact when the reviewer rebases the change.

* [Change 356354](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/356354):
Added project permission for removing votes/labels

  For every configured label `My-Name` in the project, there is a
  corresponding permission `removeLabel-My-Name` with a range corresponding to
  the defined values. For these values, the users are permitted to remove
  other users' votes from a change.

* [Change 356260](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/356260):
Fixed overriding impersonated votes

  Fix an issue where overriding an impersonated vote for a user A (real user B)
  only worked if the voting values were different. If the voting value was the
  same Gerrit wrongly assumed that the voting was a no-op.

* [Change 355574](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/355574):
Added support to remove a non-visible account as a reviewer through the
PostReview REST endpoint

  Fix an issue where, if a visible change had a reviewer whose account was not
  visible, this account could be seen on the change, but the reviewer could not
  be removed.

* [Change 351075](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351075):
Added a REST API to rebase a chain of changes

  A new API `POST /changes/{change-id}/rebase:chain` now allows to rebase an
  ancestry chain of changes.

* [Change 355116](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/355116):
Added `prefixsubject` index field (requires index upgrade)

  Similarly to `prefixhashtag` and `prefixtopic` it is not possible to search
  changes by subject prefix (e.g. a bug ID in square brackets).

* [Change 354294](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/354294):
Custom git gc-preserve command which can preserve packs for JGit

  Implemented a custom git command "git-gc-preserve" preserving old packs
  to prevent races between git gc running on a large repository
  concurrently to fetch/clone requests.

* [Change 354037](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/354037):
Added `subject` index field (requires index upgrade)

  Allow to query changes by subject.

* [Change 353674](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/353674):
Invalid label ranges for permissions are rejected when pushing a project.config file

  Attempting to add permissions with a range where `min` is greater than `max`,
  where `min` is present but `max` is missing or vice-versa throws
  an `IllegalArgumentException`.

* [Change 353635](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/353635):
Set Access REST endpoint rejects invalid label ranges

* [Change 353655](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/353655):
Do not add a duplicated project.config entry if a duplicate input is added.

  When the same request was made to the 'Set Access' project rest endpoint, it
  resulted in adding a duplicated line in the project.config.

* [Change 353287](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/353287):
Votes that are copied to follow-up patch sets when a vote on an outdated patch
  set is applied are now posted as a change message.

  When votes were copied to follow-up patch sets they were applied in NoteDb, but
  users were not informed about them. Now a change message is posted to inform
  that the vote was copied forward.

* [Change 352055](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/352055):
Reject invalid base on push with proper error message instead of failing with
  an internal server error

* [Change 352034](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/352034):
Fix GetRelated if multiple changes for the same commit exist

* [Change 351534](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351534):
Fix the issue that 404 page is shown after login

  After logging in using the "Sign in with a Launchpad ID" link Gerrit used to
  display a "not found" page.

* [Change 351614](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351614):
Do not require trailing slash for requests on root collections

  Often users are confused why 'GET /changes/' works, but 'GET /changes' doesn't.
  Both are now allowed.

* [Change 347719](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/347719):
Suppressing emails on submit is disallowed now if there is a post approval diff

  Fixes a security issue where a malicious user could submit code changes
  without anyone ever seeing them. If a change is submitted and a post approval
  diff exists, no matter which notify setting the caller specified, Notify=ALL
  is used.

* [Change 351114](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351114):
Add support for enabling Strict Dynamic CSP on Documentation pages.

* [Change 349175](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/349175):
Disallow 'cansee' account search operator with private changes

  This operator used to fail for private changes if the change owner requested
  `cansee:<private_change>`. Now, if the caller of the query is the owner or one
  of the reviewers/ccs of the change, the query returns account data for it.

* [Change 349216](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/349216):
Add a `has:submodule-updates` operator for submit requirements
