## Release highlights

Gerrit 3.6 is fully compatible with Java 17 LTS.

### Submit Requirements

Gerrit deprecates the use of Prolog for definition of custom logic in the submit rules. From this version
onwards the rules can be expressed using the new concept of [Submit Requirements](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.6.0/config-submit-requirements.html).

Submit Requirements have several advantages, compared to the legacy Prolog rules:

- Easier to understand, defined through simple boolean expressions using a
  higher-level change search predicates and common boolean operator.
- Lower footprint: they do not require backtracking in their evaluation,
  consuming less CPU cycles.
- Richer GUI: makes it easy for reviewers and change owners to identify and
  understand missing requirements.

Existing projects relying on Prolog will still work as expected, allowing a
smoother project transition.

Submit requirements also introduce new handy functions that allow to achieve
complex rules equivalent to the old Prolog rules but with an easier syntax:
- support checking on content modifications and file diffs with the `file:`
  operator.
- `distinctvoters` predicate allows gating submission on N distinct voters
  across more than one label.
- `authoremail` operator similar to the older `commit_author` Prolog predicate
- `message` predicate to support regular expression on the commit message as a
  condition.

> **NOTE**: With the new submit requirements, submit records are no longer emitted.
> This means that any queries with the label formats (`label:Code-Review=NEED` or `label:Code-Review=OK`) will
> no longer match with changes. See more details in [Change 330203](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/330203).

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't formally contain schema changes, however the NoteDb format has
evolved and includes the following amendments:

- [Change 324937](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/324937):
The label in NoteDb has a UUID suffix

- [Change 323897](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/323897):
The review score is only read from the latest patch-set

> NOTE: Because of the above incompatibilities, upgrade is supported only from
> Gerrit v3.5.2 onwards, because of the need of the extra `copy-approvals` tool
> and the backward compatibility fix on UUID suffixed labels.
> Failing to run the `copy-approvals` tool in v3.5.2 would leave the changes
> with a potentially stale approval score once the site is migrated to v3.6.

The `changes` index version has been increased to version 77. By default the
index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup after the
upgrade.

### Offline upgrade

Upgrade to [Gerrit v3.5.2](../3.5.html#352) or later and make sure that the `copy-approvals`
site program has been run at least once.

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war copy-approvals -d site_path
```

Download the [Gerrit v3.6.0 war](https://gerrit-releases.storage.googleapis.com/gerrit-3.6.0.war) and
run the `init` program:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit-3.6.0.war init -d site_path
```

Run offline reindexing of the changes:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.6.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.5.2 or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.5.2 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Run the `copy-approvals` SSH command against one of the Gerrit servers
   and wait for completion on all changes for all projects.
3. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.6.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.

### Update gerrit.reportBugUrl configuration

The issues of the Gerrit Code Review project have been migrated from
Monorail into the new Gerrit Tracker, see announcement at:
https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss/c/F4havFh_Bvw/m/D5MsV17yAgAJ

If the [gerrit.reportBugUrl](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.reportBugUrl)
setting on your Gerrit server is pointing to the Gerrit Monorail project, which
is deprecated now, please update the URL to point to the new Gerrit Tracker,
e.g. change https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/entry?template=Bug+Report
to https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/new.

### Known issues

* [Issue 380898784](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/380898784):
The new `changes_by_project` cache will make the `git-upload-pack` fail intermittently
on projects containing one or more inconsistent changes.

  The introduction of the `changes_by_project` cache is incompatible with projects
  having one or more inconsistent changes, like changes with /meta refs coming from
  unexpected Gerrit serverId.
. The cache makes the `git-upload-pack` fail intermittently
  with internal server errors when it fails to load the change meta-data depending
  on the status of the cache.
  As a workaround, disable the `changes_by_project` cache as follows in `gerrit.config`:
  ```
  [cache "changes_by_project"]
        memoryLimit = 0
  ```

### Breaking changes


* The __ignore__ feature is completely removed from Gerrit's web app; the `ignore`
and `unignore` actions and the associated `is:ignored` predicate are not supported
anymore.

  Gerrit has the attention set feature since v3.4. If you want to ignore a change,
  then you can remove yourself from the attention set or the list of reviewers/ccs.
  That makes it also clearer to your collaborators that you don't want to participate.

  The legacy __ignore__ feature did not have any effect on the user's dashboard or
  attention set but was limited to the execution of the `is:ignored` predicate.
  On Google hosted Gerrit the feature is used by about 5 users per week.
  20% of __ignore__ action clicks were accidental.

* [Change 321607](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/321607):
  _Assignee_ feature is completely removed from the Gerrit UI

  The Attention Set feature has been launched in Gerrit v3.3, and assignee
  has been turned off by default for three releases. The feature is now completely
  removed and cannot be enabled anymore by config.

* [Project Owners implicit delete reference permission has been removed](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/304054).

  Before this release all Project Owners had implicit delete permission to all
  refs unless force-push was blocked for the user.
  Admins that are relying on previous behavior or wish to maintain it for their
  users can simply add the permission explicitly in All-Projects:
  ```ini
    [access "refs/*"]
      delete = Project Owners
  ```
  > **NOTE**:  If you choose to do so, blocking force-push no longer has any effect
  > on permission to delete refs by means other than git (REST, UI).

* Support for CentOS is dropped and the base image replaced by AlmaLinux

  RedHat anticipated the [EOL of CentOS to December 2021](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) making
  hard for the Gerrit community to continue to support existing Docker setups on
  CentOS.
  The default base image now uses [AlmaLinux 8](https://almalinux.org/)
  which promises to have a much longer life as open-source OS and has an easy
  [migration tool from CentOS 8](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy)
  available.

* Apache Commons Lang v2 is removed

  Gerrit moved to [Apache Commons Lang v3](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) replacing all legacy
  use of the older lang v2 from its dependencies. Existing plugins and scripts
  that are using Apache Commons Lang v2 must be rebuilt to use the new library
  or declare the older Apache Commons Lang v2 as an explicit dependency.

  Support Cloud Spanner for AccountPatchReviewStore

* Bug Fixes

  * [Change 385557](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/385557):
  Remove warning on persisted_projects cache on multi-servers setups

    The implementation of the key for persisted_project includes the
    project version, therefore it is safe when used in a multi-servers
    scenarios (HA, multi-site).

  * [Change 380154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/380154):
  Documentation: NOTE on use of sshkeys, and \*projects cache on clusters

    When using the sshkeys, and \*projects caches on a cluster, warn
    the Gerrit admin he should be aware of those caches to be potentially
    stale. The problem can be minimised by either disabling them

  Align Jetty session timeout with Gerrit web_sessions maxAge

    Do not leave Jetty having sessions kept forever but expire
    them with the same timeout of Gerrit sessions.

    Verified E2E that the Jetty sessions expires with the same
    timeout of the web_sessions maxAge value.

  * [Issue 290225204](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/290225204):
  loginUrl and loginText are hardcoded in the UI

    Gerrit UI ignored the settings in the auth section of the
    configuration [1].

    In particular auth.loginUrl [2] should be used if present and
    auth.type is set to HTTP or HTTP_LDAP.
    Also auth.loginText [3] should be used if auth.loginUrl is set.

    This change backports change 381534 to stable-3.6. We didn't cherry-pick because the code changes significantly and had many conflicts.

  * [Issue 291102119](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/291102119):
  Avoid NullPointerException when deleting multiple tags

    To avoid NPE make sure that ref is not read again after checking if
    ref exists. This prevent the issue when other call already removed
    the tag and we try to read it. Proper behaviour is to try to delete it
    and return `Cannot delete refs/tags/...: LOCK_FAILURE` if tag is already
    deleted.

### 3.6.6

* Breaking changes

  * [Issue 40015585](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40015585):
  Enhance metric name sanitize function to remove collision on '_' between metrics.

    Collision between the sanitized metric names can be easily
    created e.g. `foo_bar` will collide with `foo+bar`. In order
    to avoid collisions keep the rules about slashes and replace not
    supported chars with `_0x[HEX CODE]_` string. The replacement prefix
    `0x` is prepended with another replacement prefix.

* New Features

  * [Issue 287484350](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/287484350):
  Extend configurability of index pagination type

    Add NONE option to disable index backend pagination, this option
    needs to be honoured by the indexing backend and this change introduces
    the correct implementation for Lucene.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 40014502](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40014502):
  Fix JdkObsolete issues with Date caused by JGit's PersonIdent class not supporting Instant

    Gerrit has quite a lot of usages of JGit's PersonIdent class. PersonIdent
    currently doesn't support Instant, but requires a java.util.Date as input.
    This fix updates PersonIdent in JGit to support Instants (offer constructors
    that accept Instant + add a getter that returns Instant), Upgrade JGit in Gerrit,
    Fix Gerrit's usages of PersonIdent to use the new constructors and getters.

  * [Change 376334](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/376334):
  Fix ExternalId differential loading when cache is inconsistent

    JGit may return a failure to update a repository, even if it actually
    succeeded. This can create an issue when loading externalIds, since
    we would retry to insert the same value into the cache twice,
    due to the retry performed by the client, leading the cache
    loader to consistently blow up.

  * [Change 347316](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347316):
  Fix Bazel build on Apple M2 ARM64 chip

    Bazel fails to select the correct java-tools binaries for Apple's ARM64
    chip and download the generic x86. This fix disable the download
    of the pre-compiled java_tools, allowing Bazel to build them
    locally using the correct architecture.

  * [Change 373186](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/373186):
  Turn on JavaUtilDate bug pattern and fix related issues

    Upcoming Bazel release 5.0 includes recent error prone release that
    flags JavaUtilDate bug pattern. Demote the severity to warning to not
    block Bazel upgrade and promote it to error severity again, when all
    places were adapted.

  * [Change 357634](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/357634):
  Fix parsing legacy labels for users with comma

    This change fixes a bug introduced by [336883](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/336883)
    when parsing labels where a UUID was present together with a user name containing a comma.

  * [Issue 289321387](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/289321387):
  Preserve refs order in the GitBatchRefUpdateEvent event

    [Change 335758](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/335758)
    introduced the concept of the single event representing batch ref update.
    However this new event did not preserve original order of the updated refs.
    This impacts event consumers behaviour and can cause failures. For example
    if meta ref is processed before patchset ref indexing operation will
    fail because of the missing patchset.

    The timeline of events is kept in the same order they are generated,
    to make sure that refs order is preserved and backward compatibility
    is kept.

* Documentation fixes

  * [Issue 40014489](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40014489):
  Announce / document that building with Java 8 is no longer supported

    Documents that building with Java 8 is no longer supported.
    Java 11 is now required and remove now unused error_prone_warnings_toolchain.


### 3.6.5

* New Features

  * [Change 364591](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/364591)
  Allow to hide download schemes from the UI

    Allow hiding a download scheme in the UI by still allowing to use it.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Change 362914](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/362914)
  Fix internal server error caused by double flush in BaseCommand.TaskThunk

    Ignore `SshChannelClosedException` when flushing the task's output and error
    streams. JGit commands like `UploadPack` flush these streams already. When
    `TaskThunk` tries to flush them again `SshChannelClosedException` is thrown
    and leads to an internal server error.

  * [Change 364478](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/364478):
  AndSource: Run `isVisibleToPredicate` based on its cost

    `isVisible` check can be expensive and always running it ahead of other
    cheaper predicates can increase the query time. Update `AndSource` to treat
    `isVisibleToPredicate` like any other predicate so that it runs based on its
    estimated cost.

  * [Issue 16819](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16819):
  Enable LDAP "Remember me" in login form per default

    When users are presented with the LDAP login page, the "Remember me" checkbox
    is disabled by default.  This might be a problem because, if the user doesn't
    explicitly click the checkbox, the session will be tied to the browser
    session.

  * [Issue 16814](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16814):
  Improve `Rebase-SubmitStrategy` performance in some cases

    Set uninteresting branches based on project configuration:
    `create_new_change_for_all_not_in_target`.

  * [Change 369415](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/369415):
  Fix metric computation with file paths in metric name.

    Don't fail metric computation due to duplicated metric names.

  * [Change 370354](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/370354):
  Improved performance of queries when backend index returns more results than needed

    Matching changes more than the limit is just extra work that is discarded at
    the end when the results are trimmed to match the limit. This can help improve
    performance of queries where a small percentage of changes are filtered in the
    initial page and the remaining results are obtained from the next page.

  * [Change 357834](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/357834):
  Improved performance for plugin-provided SSH commands that perform multiple
  permission checks or ref lookups for the same project

    Move creation of `PerThreadCache` to `SshCommand` so that the cache is available
    to most commands, including plugins.

  * [Change 360221](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/360221):
  Add metric for memory allocated by all threads

    Introduce [proc/jvm/memory/allocated](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/metrics.html#_process)
    which can be used to monitor total memory allocation rate causing work for the Java gc.

  * [Change 361434](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/361434):
  Mark `LabelType.Builder#setFunction` as deprecated

    Align the code with the
    [documentation](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.6.3/config-labels.html#label_function).

  * [Issue 16823](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16823):
  Fix the search by query in the project filter

    Fix regression introduced in [Change 337994](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/337994),
    in context of [Issue 15134](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15134).

* Download-commands plugin fixes

  * [Issue 15944](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15944):
  scp command for retrieving commit-sh hook fails with OpenSSH 9.0

    Http should always be available from primary servers and using scp is getting
    complicated since the implementation of scp varies between different OpenSSH
    versions.

* Dependency Updates

  * Update jgit to 5ae8d28faaf6168921f673c89a4e6d601ffad78d.

  * [JGit Bug 565854](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=565854)
  `SshdSession`: close channel gracefully

    Close the channel gracefully to give the server a chance to clean up properly on
    its side.

  * Update bouncycastle to 1.72.

  * Update commons-compress to 1.22.

### 3.6.4

* New features

  * [Issue 16565](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16565):
  Introduce cache.threads option to allow custom executors for Caffeine caches.

    The introduction of `cache.threads` in `gerrit.config` allows to configure
    a separate thread pool which can be tuned and decoupled from the
    rest of the JVM common threads.

  * [Change 353177](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/353177):
  Add tsconfig-plugins-base.json to Gerrit TypeScript Plugin API.

    Adds `tsconfig-plugins-base.json` to the npm package so downstream plugins
    can easily use the same set of TypeScript settings.

  * [Issue 16445](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16445):
  Add slice number to the change indexing task description.

    To indicate to the administrator each task is indeed doing something
    different, add the slice number if there is more than one slice in
    total.

  * [Change 356215](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/356215):
  Support `init --reindex-threads=-1` to skip reindexing after init.

    Admins may wish to run other commands after `init` and before `reindex`, but
    previously would have needed to observe and interrupt the `init` command
    process once it started reindexing in order to do so. Providing an option to
    `init` that skips the reindexing phase simplifies that workflow and makes it
    less error prone.

  * [Change 356234](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/356234):
  Add CUDA syntax highlighting.

  * [Change 352534](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/352534):
  Introduce `--show-cache-stats` for printing cache stats during `init` and `reindex`,
  disabled by default.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Change 351674](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/351674):
  SSH review cmd handles lock failures with retries.

    Retrying on lock failures helps mitigating lock failures when there is
    contention to lock the notedb ref. Retries were already implemented
    in REST API code path at a high enough layer so that it applies for all
    REST APIs.

  * [Change 353594](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/353594):
  Inserting new patch-sets is retried on lock failures.

    Mitigates failures when creating new patch-sets fails if the notedb
    ref is locked for another update on the change.

  * [Issue 14686](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14686), [Issue 14779](https://crbug.com/gerrit/14779), [Issue 16030](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16030):

    In [Change 293978](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/293978), eTag was
    removed from GetRevisionActions, but not RevisionResource. This resulted
    in the UI to show a stale 'submit' action on the change in the same
    submission chain. The UI now uses RevisionResource eTag, that does not include
    MergeSuperSet (all related changes).

  * [Issue 16409](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16409):
  Report pack protocol errors to the client via smart-HTTP.

    A regression introduced by [JGit Change 1926771](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/192677),
    caused pack protocol errors to be reported as 500 Server errors.
    Such situations should be reported to the user as a 200 OK containing the
    details of the failed operation.

  * [Change 351759](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/351759):
  Fix `contrib/find-duplicate-usernames.sh` output when usernames contain spaces.

  * [Issue 16449](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16449):
  Fix project root computation in Gitweb servlet.

  * [Change 356715](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/356715):

  * [Change 359176](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/359176):
  Fix LabelPredicate group matching for included external groups.

  * [Change 357874](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/357874):
  Fixed ownerin/uploaderin for internal groups that include external groups.

  * [Change 355054](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/355054):
  Wrap #mobileSearch in a div.

    Fixes an issue on wikimedia where the search button was hidden
    even though the rules executed to make it show.

  * [Issue 16433](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16433):
  Fix 404 page shown after login using OpenID

### 3.6.3

* New features

  * [Issue 16322](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16322):
  Limit the number of changes that can be submitted together

    When chaining changes together, the sequence of commits to navigate
    was previously unbound, causing the potential operations explosion.
    The explosion could have also been accidental and caused by the push
    of a change with a non-existent branch, which would have resulted
    in the full scan of the repository for changes.
    Introduce a new Gerrit configuration `change.maxSubmittableAtOnce` with
    a safe default of `1024`, which would allow any use case that would have
    also worked before this change.

  * [Change 347496](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347496):
  Enable project_list cache warmer when `cache.project_list.maxAge` is set

  * [Change 341454](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/341454):
  GitwebServlet: Retrieve git path from FileRepository so that it can be used
  with multi-site and cached-refdb modules

* Native packaging

  * GerritForge RPM repository updated for arm64 architecture

    [GerritForge RPM v1.4](https://gerritforge.com/gerritforge-repo-1-4.noarch.rpm)
    has been released, including the native packages for arm64 architecutre.

  * DockerHub images for arm64 architecture

    [DockerHub Gerrit images](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit/tags?page=1&name=3.6.3)
    include images for arm64 architecture.

* Performance Fixes

  * [Change 350577](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/350577)
  copy-approvals: use multiple threads for copy-approvals, improve performance

    Split the work into slices of changes and then utilize one thread per slice.
    Also skip unnecessary reindexing. On a large Gerrit site with 1.3 million
    changes, this reduced the time for copy-approvals from 5 hours to 15-20
    minutes.

  * [Change 350236](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/350236)
  Optimized change visibilty checking when the project is hidden

    Looping over every change when the whole project isn't readable is a
    waste of CPU. It's a bigger waste to fetch all the change data in the
    first place.

  * [Issue 16379](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16379):
  Remove key locking for disabled caches

    This change also makes the memoryLimit behaviour consistent with the
    diskLimit set to zero means disabling the implementation of the cache.

  * [Change 349895](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349895):
  Add AndCardinalPredicate and OrCardinalPredicate

    Before this change, IndexSource derived cardinality from predicate
    which implement `HasCardinality`. Since `AndPredicate` and `OrPredicate`
    does not return cardinality, IndexSource defaults to 10 when query
    comprises more than one predicate. Due to this behavior, `AndSource`
    chooses IndexSource almost always when query contains more than one
    index predicate.
    This helps `AndSource` to choose the right source more often.

  * [Change 347956](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347956):
  Introduce possibility to define the cardinality so that `AndSource` predicate
  can work more efficiently

    Before this change, cardinality of the IndexSource was always set to
    10. This makes `AndSource` to choose IndexSource over other sources most of
    the time.
    Add a `HasCardinality` interface which can be used by all the predicates
    which implement IndexPredicate to set a cardinality. This helps
    AndSource to choose the right datasource.

  * [Change 349355](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349355):
  Cache repository locations in LocalDiskRepositoryManager

    Obtaining the actual location of a repository using base-path
    and project name can be slow as it involves some guessing to
    locate the repository. Cache the locations once they are
    obtained to avoid repeated work, thereby improving performance
    when opening repositories.

  * [Change 347955](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347955):
  Consider cardinality while choosing the data source for `AndSource` predicate

    Before this change, `AndSource` considered cost to choose a datasource.
    Ideally cost should be used to determine which predicate to run
    `#match()` against first, so that queries are faster. Cardinality should
    be used to determine which datasource to be picked so that there are
    fewer changes to process.
    Consider cardinality of the datasource to choose the source and use
    cost when cardinality is same.

* Bug Fixes

  copy-approvals: continue when there are corrupt meta-refs in a project

    If there was a corrupt meta-ref in a project, the copy-approvals

  * [Change 77495](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347495):
    Fix for IllegalStateException during the Gerrit start when
    `cache.projects.refreshAfterWrite` is set to true and prolog rules are used

  * [Change 350014](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/350014):
  Do not set cherryPickOf on RevertSubmission

    The RevertSubmission internally uses CherryPickChange operation.  It
    creates the 'normal' revert for the first change in the relation chain,
    for each subsequent change it creates a revert commit that is then
    cherry-picked. This cherry-pick is not a cherry-pick of the reverted
    change. This is a cherry-pick of the revert commit of the original
    change.
    This change fixes the bug in the logic that sets cherryPickOf to the
    original (reverted) change, using the CherryPickChange operation.

  * [Change 349894](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/349894):
  Don't always rewrite And/OrPredicate to And/OrSource

    Before this change OrPredicate was always rewritten to OrSource. This
    is not the right thing to do as `OrSource#read()` will eventually fail
    when there is at least one non-datasource child. Since
    [Change 347955](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347955),
    `AndSource` picks a source which has the lowest cardinality
    which makes the `OrSource#read()` failures more visible.
    Rewrite `OrPredicate` to `OrSource` only when all the children in the
    predicate are DataSources.

  * [Change 348715](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/348715);
  Clarify that a restart is needed before changes to email templates take
  effect

  * [Issue 16182](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16182):

    the Gerrit UI.

  * [Issue 10168](https://crbug.com/gerrit/10168):
  Fix HTTP 404 when browsing tags on Gitweb

    The Gitweb links to tags have been broken in v2.14.10 onwards.
    Gitweb supports the 'a=tags' rendering action for annotated tags
    only, returning 404 for all lightweight tags.
    Use the generic 'a=shortlog' for Gitweb links to tags which would
    work for both annotated and lightweight ones.

  * [Change 347495](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/347495):
  Fix for IllegalStateException during the Gerrit start when
  `cache.projects.refreshAfterWrite` is set to true and prolog rules are used

  * [Issue 15997](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15997):

  access it

### 3.6.2

* Security Fixes

  * [Issue 16054](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16054):
  Fix confidentiality leak by users with create ref permission
  using the create branch REST-API

    Any user with create ref permission was able to gain
    access to any SHA1 or refs, including the ones that they would
    not have permission to see.

* Breaking changes

  * [Issue 15941](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15941):
  Fix SSH queries to not show commit-message unless --commit-message is provided

    This issue has existed for several years and should be considered
    breaking as users might expect commit message to be included by
    default in SSH query results.
    Obtaining the commit message is a costly operation as the commit
    data has to be loaded. So, showing it even when --commit-message
    is not provided degrades the performance of SSH queries.

  * [Change 344300](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/344300):
  Add missing return values in MetricMaker's `newCallbackMetric` and
  `newConstantMetric`

    When new callback and constant metrics were created the RegistrationHandle
    was not returned, making impossible to de-register them.
    The method signature is now aligned, however, all plugins, including the core ones,
    that were registering callback or constant metrics would need to be rebuilt from
    source or downloaded from the latest build on
    [Gerrit-CI](https://gerrit-ci.gerritforge.com).

* New features

  * [Change 347496](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/347496):
  New configuration option to periodically warm the project_list cache

    Reduce the likelihood of the project_list cache being evicted
    by providing an option to periodically warm it up.
    When this warmer is enabled, change detail page loads are
    consistently faster.

  * [Change 346254](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/346254):
  Fix change queries evaluation of `AND` terms  to run match on predicate whose cost is
  least

    Sort the change queries predicates in `AND` based on cost and cardinality, which
    was broken since [Change 79391](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/79391).

    **WARNING**: queries containing predicates with poorly defined costs or cardinalities
    could perform worse now.
