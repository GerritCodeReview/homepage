### Breaking changes

* [Project Owners implicit delete reference permission have been removed](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/304054).

  Before this change all Project Owners had implicit delete permission to all refs
  unless force-push was blocked for the user.
  Admins that are relying on this behavior or whish to maintain it for their users
  can simply add the permission explicitly in All-Projects:
  ```sh
    [access "refs/*"]
	    delete = Project Owners
  ```
  > **NOTE**:  If you choose to do so, blocking force-push no longer has any effect
  > on permission to delete refs by means other than git (REST, UI).
