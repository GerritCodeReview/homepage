## Release highlights

### Submit Requirements

Gerrit deprecates the use of Prolog for definition of custom logic in the submit rules. From this version
onwards the rules can be expressed using the new concept of [Submit Requirements](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.6.0/config-submit-requirements.html).

Submit Requirements have several advantages, compared to the legacy Prolog rules:

- Easier to understand, defined through simple boolean expressions using a
  higher-level change search predicates and common boolean operator.
- Lower footprint: they do not require backtracking in their evaluation,
  consuming less CPU cycles.
- Richer GUI: makes it easy for reviewers and change owners to identify and
  understand missing requirements.

Existing projects relying on Prolog will still work as expected, allowing a
smoother project transition.

Submit requirements also introduce new handy functions that allow to achieve
complex rules equivalent to the old Prolog rules but with an easier syntax:
- support checking on content modifications and file diffs with the `file:`
  operator.
- `distinctvoters` predicate allows gating submission on N distinct voters
  across more than one label.
- `authoremail` operator similar to the older `commit_author` Prolog predicate
- `message` predicate to support regular expression on the commit message as a
  condition.

> **NOTE**: With the new submit requirements, submit records are no longer emitted.
> This means that any queries with the label formats (`label:Code-Review=NEED` or `label:Code-Review=OK`) will
> no longer match with changes. See more details in [Change 330203](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/330203).

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

This release doesn't formally contain schema changes, however the NoteDb format has
evolved and includes the following amendments:

- [Change 324937](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/324937):
The label in NoteDb has a UUID suffix

- [Change 323897](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/323897):
The review score is only read from the latest patch-set

> NOTE: Because of the above incompatibilities, upgrade is supported only from
> Gerrit v3.5.2 onwards, because of the need of the extra `copy-approvals` tool
> and the backward compatibility fix on UUID suffixed labels.
> Failing to run the `copy-approvals` tool in v3.5.2 would leave the changes
> with a potentially stale approval score once the site is migrated to v3.6.

The `changes` index version has been increased to version 77. By default the
index is automatically rebuilt upon the Gerrit startup after the
upgrade.

### Offline upgrade

Upgrade to [Gerrit v3.5.2](../3.5.html#352) or later and make sure that the `copy-approvals`
site program has been run at least once.

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war copy-approvals -d site_path
```

Download the [Gerrit v3.6.0 war](https://gerrit-releases.storage.googleapis.com/gerrit-3.6.0.war) and
run the `init` program:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit-3.6.0.war init -d site_path
```

Run offline reindexing of the changes:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex --index changes -d site_path
```

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.6.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.5.2 or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.5.2 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Run the `copy-approvals` SSH command against one of the Gerrit servers
   and wait for completion on all changes for all projects.
3. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.6.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.

### Breaking changes

* [Change 321607](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/321607):
  _Assignee_ feature is completely removed from the Gerrit UI

  The Attention Set feature has been launched in Gerrit v3.3, and assignee
  has been turned off by default for three releases. The feature is now completely
  removed and cannot be enabled anymore by config.

* [Project Owners implicit delete reference permission has been removed](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/304054).

  Before this release all Project Owners had implicit delete permission to all
  refs unless force-push was blocked for the user.
  Admins that are relying on previous behavior or wish to maintain it for their
  users can simply add the permission explicitly in All-Projects:
  ```ini
    [access "refs/*"]
      delete = Project Owners
  ```
  > **NOTE**:  If you choose to do so, blocking force-push no longer has any effect
  > on permission to delete refs by means other than git (REST, UI).

* Support for CentOS is dropped and the base image replaced by AlmaLinux

  RedHat anticipated the [EOL of CentOS to December 2021](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) making
  hard for the Gerrit community to continue to support existing Docker setups on
  CentOS.
  The default base image now uses [AlmaLinux 8](https://almalinux.org/)
  which promises to have a much longer life as open-source OS and has an easy
  [migration tool from CentOS 8](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy)
  available.

* Apache Commons Lang v2 is removed

  Gerrit moved to [Apache Commons Lang v3](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) replacing all legacy
  use of the older lang v2 from its dependencies. Existing plugins and scripts
  that are using Apache Commons Lang v2 must be rebuilt to use the new library
  or declare the older Apache Commons Lang v2 as an explicit dependency.

## Other dependency changes

* Update sshd to 2.8.0

  extension: the server announces that it prefers the SHA-2 signatures
  for RSA keys.

  - [SSHD-1197](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-1197):
  A race condition in key exchange fixed.

  - [SSHD-1163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-1163):

  Additionally, sshd 2.8.0 now supports (and prefers) the
  chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com cipher [SSHD-1017](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-1017),
  and supports the curve25519 and curve448 KEX algorithms [SSHD-704](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SSHD-704).
