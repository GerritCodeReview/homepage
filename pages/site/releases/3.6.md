## Release highlights

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

### Zero-downtime upgrade

Gerrit v3.6.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.3.x, v3.4.x or v3.5.x
when configured using a
[high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or similar.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.3.x, v3.4.x or v3.5.x in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.6.x and start
   Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
6. Repeat steps 2. to 5. for all the other Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.3.x, v3.4.x or v3.5.x release is possible, but requires
the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit v3.6.x servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.3.x, v3.4.x or v3.5.x version
3. Run offline reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version
3. Startup Gerrit server

> **NOTE**: Downgrading is not always possible in Gerrit and is subject to
> specific restrictions on different releases. Always read the release notes
> carefully and look for the supported downgrade paths.
