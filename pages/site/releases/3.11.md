## Release highlights

### Java 21

The language level used for Gerrit source code stays on `Java 17`, however, Gerrit
is built and distributed for `Java 21`, which is the recommended JVM version for
running it in production.

### Enforce project configuration changes for code review

It is now possible to enforce project configuration changes for code review, ensuring modifications
are reviewed and approved before integration (by setting
`gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate=true`).

This feature, together with a dedicated set of endpoints such as
`/projects/myproject/access:review`, `/projects/myproject/labels:review`,
`/projects/myproject/submit_requirements:review` and
`/projects/myproject/config:review`, allows to prevent that any project configuration changes is
submitted without code review.

### New maintenance APIs

Some maintenance operations can be configured in `gerrit.config` to be executed at a specific time.
However, this might not always be wanted or could even lead to issues in setups where multiple
Gerrit instances with the same configuration try to perform the operation concurrently.

To work around this problem, for some specific operations, one can now explicitly call dedicated
REST API on demand, specifically:
[Clean up of stale changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/rest-api-config.html#cleanup.changes)
and [Clean up of stale accounts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/rest-api-config.html#account-deactivation).

### New metrics

The new `receivecommits/reject_count` set of metrics to count the number of rejected pushes has been
added. This is useful to monitor push errors over time and the reason of their failure.

Additionally one can explicitly
set [performance.metrics](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/config-gerrit.html#performance.metric.operation)
to record latency and counts of specific operations.

Please bear in mind that the above metrics can quickly build up in number, eventually increasing the
latency and the size of collecting metrics payloads via to monitoring such as `prometheus`.

### New Submit requirements

Submit requirements now support `WANT_LGTM=all` functionality, enabling changes to be submittable
only when all human reviewers have approved. The new syntax
`label:Code-Review>=1,users=human_reviewers` can be used in submit requirement expressions to
match changes approved by all reviewers.

Additionally, `WANT_LGTM=all` can be configured to apply automatically to all changes or selectively
enabled for changes containing a specific footer (e.g., `Want-Code-Review: all`), allowing users to
require unanimous approval on demand.

## Important Notes

### Schema and index changes

No changes to either the schema or indexes versions.

### Online index schema upgrade from 3.10

If you’re upgrading from `3.10`, the Lucene index does not need any rebuild.
If you’re upgrading from `3.9`, the Lucene index is automatically rebuilt upon Gerrit startup after
the upgrade.

However, if you’re upgrading from `3.8` or an earlier version, you must use the Offline
upgrade steps below, because of the Lucene upgrade mentioned in the
`3.8` [release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.10.html#schema-and-index-changes).

### Offline upgrade

- Download the new `gerrit.war`
- Stop Gerrit
- Backup the existing indexes in case a rollback is required
- Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
- Run init `java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch`
- If you are upgrading from a `3.9`/`3.10` versions you don’t need to run reindex
  (see `Online index schema upgrade from 3.10` above).

  If you are upgrading from a `3.8` or an earlier version, you must run a reindex
  of all indexes:

  `java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path`

  See the
  [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/pgm-reindex.html)
  command for other options.

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.11.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.10 when configured
using either
[high-availability](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
or
[multi-site](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/multi-site/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
setup.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users will not experience any
outage or service disruption and will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation seamlessly.

The zero-downtime upgrade process for high-availability or multi-site setups
consists of the following steps ([demo](https://youtu.be/vK5qsb0W7q4)):

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.9 or v3.10 in high-availability or multi-site
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set one of the Gerrit servers to unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.11.x and start Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Ensure the Gerrit server is fully caught up with the events that happened while
   it was down before directing traffic to it.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each of the remaining Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to Gerrit v3.9 or v3.10 release is possible, but requires the following
manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.9 or v3.10 version
3. Init Gerrit

  ```sh
    java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
  ```

4. Startup Gerrit server

### Native packaging

- `Almalinux` distribution updated  `9.4`.
- `Ubuntu` distribution updated to `v24.04`.

## Security Fixes

* [Change 435557](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435557):
  Add Option to set HttpOnly flag for cookies.

  This option helps to prevent possible XSS-attacks.

* [Change 435998](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435998):
  Change default of auth.cookieHttpOnly to true.

  This makes the `auth.cookieHttpOnly` cookie more secure by default as there should usually be no
  need to allow client side javascript to access it.

* [Change 435960](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435960):
  Don't allow discovery of non-visible groups.

  A user could have used the `ls-members` command to distinguish between a non-existent group and an
  existent but not visible group. This fixes that.

### Known issues

* [Issue 309098227](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/309098227) [Change 360646](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/360646):
The introduction of a per-request ref cache for better performance may break
the repository consistency

  The addition of a new `core.usePerRequestRefCache` setting, true by
  default, introduced a per request (currently per request thread) ref
  cache, helping reduce the overhead of checking if the packed-refs file
  was outdated. However, in some scenarios, such as multi-site or
  concurrency between `git-receive-pack` and `git-gc`, it may lead to
  split-brain inconsistencies and, in the worst-case scenario, to the
  corruption of the underlying repository.

* [Issue 380898784](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/380898784):
The new `changes_by_project` cache will make the `git-upload-pack` fail intermittently
on projects containing one or more inconsistent changes.

  The introduction of the `changes_by_project` cache is incompatible with projects
  having one or more inconsistent changes, like changes with /meta refs coming from
  unexpected Gerrit serverId.
  The cache makes the `git-upload-pack` fail intermittently
  with internal server errors when it fails to load the change meta-data depending
  on the status of the cache.
  As a workaround, disable the `changes_by_project` cache as follows in `gerrit.config`:
  ```
  [cache "changes_by_project"]
        memoryLimit = 0
  ```

### Breaking Changes

* [Change 434037](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/434037):
  Disallowed tracing configs that trigger tracing for too many requests

  When using a `tracing.<trace-id>` subsection in `gerrit.config` one must now specify at least one
  of `requestUriPattern`, `account` and `projectPattern`, or otherwise it is ignored.

* [Change 429818](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429818),
  [Change 429819](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429819)
  and [Change 429820](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429820):
  Removed etags for `change`, `revision` and `ListFiles` resources.

  Any REST clients built expecting that ETags exist and that rely on them for workflows, may require
  modifications.

* [Change 442068](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442068):
  Do not notify listeners when performing online reindexing

### Breaking Changes - Replication plugin

* [Change 430660](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/430660) Prevent replication plugin start
  with invalid remotes:

  Allow the Gerrit admin to detect early a configuration issue with the remotes. Upon invalid
  remotes configuration the plugin will not start and an error will be thrown:
  `Unable to start replication plugin because remote`.

* [Issue 320715545](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/320715545) Use SecureStore for
  reading username/password credentials

  Use SecureStore for reading username/password credentials. Existing installations may have
  used a mix of encrypted and clear text credentials in `secure.config`, leveraging the replication
  plugin bug that was not accessing it using the correct API. Introduce a legacy feature flag
  `gerrit.useLegacyCredentials` that allow the Gerrit admin to still use the legacy mode.

### New Features

* [Change 409734](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/409734):
  New REST API endpoint for deactivating stale accounts.

  You can now `POST /config/server/deactivate.stale.accounts` to trigger account deactivation
  outside the time window scheduled in `gerrit.config`.

* [Change 421120](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/421120):
  A `Blocked Users` group that allows admin to block spammers is created automatically during the
  site initialisation.

  This change makes it easier to block spamming users by automatically creating the `Blocked Users`
  group with the `BLOCK` read permissions on `refs/*`. All admins need to do to block users is
  adding them to the group.

* [Issue 317351858](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/317351858):
  Submitting changes with unresolved comments is blocked for new sites by default

* [Change 420300](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/420300):
  Added REST API to clean old changes.

  You can now `POST /config/server/cleanup.changes` to abandon changes older than some given time
  outside the time window scheduled in `gerrit.config`.

* [Change 247812](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/247812)
  and [Change 248034](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/248034):
  Added support for plugins to block WorkQueue tasks without depriving other tasks of a thread.

  Introduces a `TaskParker` interface allowing selective task parking to control resource usage by
  deprioritizing certain tasks without blocking other tasks from using resources.

  Tasks blocked from running by `TaskParker` implementations show their state as `parked`.

* [Change 425478](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425478):
  Support multiple parents in the `Get Patch` API.

  Now the "Get Patch" API can handle a new `parent` flag to select which parent to use to generate
  the patch.

* [Change 426018](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/426018):
  Added highlight support for the `epp` language.

* [Change 425804](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425804):
  Added REST API endpoint for creating project config change.

  Similar to the `access:review` endpoint, this allows creating a change for project configuration
  updates via REST API by `PUT /projects/myproject/config:review`.

* [Change 425805](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425805):
  Added REST API endpoint for creating a change for labels update.

  Allows CRUD operations on multiple label definitions in this project at once by
  `POST /projects/myproject/labels:review`.

* [Change 425806](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425806):
  Added REST API endpoints for batch updating submit requirements.

  Introduced two new endpoints for updating submit requirements. One for updating without a review:
  `POST /projects/myproject/submit_requirements/` Another for creating a change for the update:
  `POST /projects/myproject/submit_requirements:review`.

* [Change 425525](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425525):
  Added API option to apply patches that conflict.

  `POST /changes/{change-id}/patch:apply` now takes a payload that allows an optional
  `allow_conflicts` field, to tolerate conflicts and add conflict markers where required.

* [Change 425807](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425807):
  Added a new config for protecting project config from unreviewed updates.

  When `gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate` is set to `true`, all attempts to update a project
  config directly using any REST API are rejected. Instead, users should always use APIs which
  create a config change (for review).

* [Change 425808](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425808):
  `Save for review` button was added into the project config page.

  When `gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate` is set to `true` a new `Save for review` is added to
  the project config page.

* [Change 429017](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429017):
  Introduce `@DynamicItem.Final` for allowing immutable dynamic bindings of interfaces to
  implementations in other plugins.

* [Change 429823](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429823):
  Add `TRIVIAL_REBASE_WITH_MESSAGE_UPDATE` ChangeKind to allow automatic vote copy in this case.

  Introduce a new ChangeKind type representing a conflict-free merge between the new parent and the
  prior patch set but having a commit message update.

* [Change 439642](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/439642):
  Report number of documents in the indexes REST API.

  This can be useful to observe index size, especially while a new index version is being created.

* [Change 438704](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438704):
  `LockManager` as an extension point.

  Provides a mechanism for global locks in distributed setups. This allows implementing global
  locking beyond project creation, such as ensuring only one Gerrit server runs certain tasks at a
  time (e.g. aut-abandoning, git-gc, account-deactivation and so forth).

* [Change 439124](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/439124):
  Allow applying fixes to different patchsets.

  The `Apply Provided Fix` API now supports applying fixes to older patchsets, enabling users to
  apply fixes not just to the current patchset.

* [Change 438424](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438424):
  Add support for `Vue` code highlighting.

* [Change 437343](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/437343):
  Added screen to browse the server info.

  Users can find important properties of the server listed in a new server info page.

* [Change 436218](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436218):
  Added extension point that allows plugins to provide server metadata.

* [Change 436318](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436318):
  Allow admins to get the account state of other users via REST API.

* [Issue 435999](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435999):
  Add method `resolveExactIgnoreVisibility` for `AccountResolver`.

  This method can be used by plugins to be able to Ignore Visibility when doing exact resolving of
  an account.

* [Change 435937](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435937):
  Added extension point that allows plugins to provide account state metadata.

  Provide an extension point that enables plugins to supply additional data for account states which
  are returned from the `Get Account State` REST endpoint.

* [Change 435819](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435819):
  Added REST endpoint to retrieve the account state with a single request.

  The new `GET /accounts/link:#account-id/self/state` can now be used Retrieves the superset of all
  information related to an account, including its permissions.

* [Change 435559](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435559):
  For users that have the 'View Access' global capability return ACL info when request is rejected
  due to a permission issue.

* [Change 435017](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435017):
  Plugin provided `change-metadata-items` can be placed above `submit-requirements`.

  With this change, plugins can choose to place items above the submit requirements.

* [Change 433022](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/433022):
  Added support for configurable performance metrics.

  A new `performance.metric` configuration section can be used in `gerrit.config` to specify
  operations
  for latency and count recording in performance metrics. This is useful to identify slow operations
  and assess the impact of optimizations.

* [Change 431638](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/431638):
  Added metric to count rejected pushes.

  The new `receivecommits/reject_count` set of metrics count the number of rejected pushes. They are
  suffixed with the push kind (either `direct`, for direct pushes, or `magic`, for pushes to magic
  refs) and with the reason of the rejection (e.g. `branch_not_found`, `no_new_changes`, and so
  forth), for example: `receivecommits_reject_count_magic_branch_for_main_not_found`,
  `receivecommits_reject_count_direct_prohibited_by_Gerrit:_not_permitted:_create`.

* [Issue 321784728](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/321784728):
  Add support for using subsections in `passwd`.

  Fixes a bug whereby the `java -jar bin/gerrit.war passwd` program couldn't be used to set a
  subsection config, such as `remote.instance.username`.

* [Change 442063](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442063):
  Support enabling `WANT_LGTM=all` via submit requirements

* [Change 442084](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442084):
  Allow to run periodic group reindexing also on Gerrit primary server.

* [Change 442065](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442065):
  New configuration style for period indexers

  Deprecate `index.scheduledIndexer` configuration in favor of `scheduledIndexer.groups` to support
  explicit indexing groups and future reindexing configurations for other indexes. Both
  configuration styles are supported, but the former is deprecated.

* [Change 442105](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442105):
  Allow to schedule periodic project reindexing

  This may be useful in high-availability scenarios where each primary maintains its own index. For
  example, if messages between the primaries are not delivered due to prolonged downtime of one of
  the primaries the projects index will become consistent again on the next run of the periodic
  project indexer. This is currently supported only for `projects` and `groups` indexes.

* [Change 444041](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/444041):
  Enable highlighting for nix

### Performance improvements

* [Change 422522](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422522):
  Avoid double loading of change notes when retrieving change without specifying a meta rev ID.

* [Change 426537](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/426537):
  Improve performance of changes queries when using the custom permission backends.

  The virtual host module, or other permissions backends, can potentially restrict the visibility of
  users to a limited set of projects or changes.

* [Issue 365254275](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/365254275):
  Don't sync bulk actions details for anonymous user.

  This change effectively reduces potential system load and improves overall performance by
  preventing anonymous users calls from loading unnecessary data.

### Bug fixes

* [Change 422518](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422518):
  Record duration of performance events in nanos (instead of in millis).

  Performance events shorter than `1ms` were being recorded with a duration of `0ms`, causing them
  to be invisible on performance charts and making it unclear whether they were executed or just too
  fast to be displayed.

* [Change 422039](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422039):
  Fix Cloud Spanner error codes for AccountPatchReviewStore.

* [Change 429801](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429801):
  Fix evaluation of extra query provided by a permission backend.

* [Change 430917](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/430917):
  Allow Gerrit to open more than 10240 file descriptors on MacOS.

* [Change 438861](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438861):
  Fixed ls-projects to skip corrupted repositories.

  The `ls-projects` command now logs an error and continues processing other projects if a
  `MissingObjectException` occurs due to a corrupted Git repository, rather than stopping execution
  entirely.

* [Change 437821](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/437821):
  Fixed `GET /auth-check.svg` error.

* [Change 436057](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436057):
  Fixed exception in GetMessage REST endpoint when the change contained multiple footers with the
  same key.

  Only the last footer for any footer key is now returned.

* [Change 435938](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435938):
  `AccountResolver:resolveExact` can now resolve accounts for usernames.

  `AccountResolver:resolveExact` now supports resolving accounts by exact username matches, avoiding
  unintended results from fuzzy matching.

* [Change 434177](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/434177):
  Disallowed ref creation when passed object is neither Commit nor a Tag.

  Restrict ref creation to only `Commit` or `Tag` objects, preventing unintended ref creation for
  unsupported object types.

* [Change 441202](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/441202):
  Fixed change email threading in Microsoft clients.

* [Change 442621](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/442621):
  Respect project config and user preference for creating changes as work-in-progress by default for
  the Revert REST endpoint.

  Do not grant `Revert` permission to `Registered Users` by default.

  Note, `Registered Users` can still revert changes via git push, just not via the web UI.

* [Change 421141](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/421141):
  Do not grant `direct` push permission by default.

  Resolved an issue where attempting to update an existing edit via push was rejected due to
  non-fast-forward updates being disallowed.

* [Issue 341288175](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/341288175):
  Ignore global ACLs query limit for internal user.

* [Change 431080](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/431080):
  Include `replication-api.jar` in `release.war`.

    Fix an issue introduced in Gerrit 3.11.4 where plugins' persisted caches weren't persisted anymore.

  * [Issue 437005987](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/437005987):
    Prevent creation of tag via rest-api if project is in read only state.

    Groups with external subgroups were unaffected.

  * [Issue 435230894](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/435230894)

### 3.11.4

* Known issues

  * [Issue 437141693](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/437141693):
  Plugins' persisted caches aren't persisted anymore, due to the removal of the lazy
  initialization of the H2Cache's bloomfilter.

    The introduction of the performance improvement in [Change 473682](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/473682) has removed
    the lazy initialization of the H2Cache's bloomfilter which is needed for enabling
    the persistence of the cache keys. The consequence is that the plugins that were
    declaring a persistent cache would not be able to persist their cached values
    anymore.

* JGit changes
  * [Change 485904](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/485904):
  Bump JGit to 3f3f3b5a6

  This includes a fix for races that could occur when deleting refs and
  another actor tries to pack refs.

  You can retrieve the full list of changes with:
  ```
  git log --no-merges --format=oneline e328d2...3f3f3b5

* Bug Fixes

  * [Issue 430336832](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/430336832):
    Align delete refs to the rest of Gerrit

    The ChangeEditUtil.deleteRef() and StarredChangesUtilNoteDbImpl.deleteRef()
    failed to set the new object id in the RefUpdate, causing a situation where
    other parts of the code are expecting a non-null SHA1 and therefore causing
    potential NPEs.

  * [Change 486742](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/486742):
    Fixed project list cache data race due to Caffeine issue

  * [Issue 412679366](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/412679366):
    Fixed an issue with a comment's resolved flag not updating

    When PostReview.comments is set, they are supposed to replace the value of the
    draft with the same id (if one exists). The logic were replacing the message,
    but not the resolved bit. Leading to the update being lost.

  * [Change 482026](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/482026):
    Fixed reindexing stale changes in projects with encoded characters

    Without this fix, any project with characters in its name that must be
    encoded would fail staleness checks with a "repository not found:
    Invalid name" message

  * [Change 473802](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/473802):

### 3.11.3

    Find changes by change number only if imported server IDs are configured.

* Enhancements

  * [Issue 401141848](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/401141848):
    Fix ref existence check when creating new refs.

    Gerrit v3.6 introduced a [new check](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/287790)
    for verifying the existence of refs before crating new refs and avoiding misleading
    `LOCK_FAILURE` errors. The check was implemented using a `Repository.resolve()`
    API which would expand the ref name as it was a logical name resolution
    causing the inability to push some refs, like tags that use the
    _git describe_ in their names. The issue is fixed by using
    a proper refs finding and brings back the full refs creation functionality.

  * [Change 472521](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/472521):
    Render markdown in check run description
