## Release highlights

### Java 21

The language level used for Gerrit source code stays on `Java 17`, however, Gerrit
is built and distributed for `Java 21`, which is the recommended JVM version for
running it in production.

### Enforce project configuration changes for code review

It is now possible to enforce project configuration changes for code review, ensuring modifications
are reviewed and approved before integration (by setting
`gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate=true`).

This feature, together with a dedicated set of endpoints such as
`/projects/myproject/access:review`, `/projects/myproject/labels:review`,
`/projects/myproject/submit_requirements:review` and
`/projects/myproject/config:review`, allows to prevent that any project configuration changes is
submitted without code review.

### New maintenance APIs

Some maintenance operations can be configured in `gerrit.config` to be executed at a specific time.
However, this might not always be wanted or could even lead to issues in setups where multiple
Gerrit instances with the same configuration try to perform the operation concurrently.

To work around this problem, for some specific operations, one can now explicitly call dedicated
REST API on demand, specifically:
[Clean up of stale changes](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/rest-api-config.html#cleanup.changes)
and [Clean up of stale accounts](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/rest-api-config.html#account-deactivation).

### New metrics

The new `receivecommits/reject_count` set of metrics to count the number of rejected pushes has been
added. This is useful to monitor push errors over time and the reason of their failure.

Additionally one can explicitly
set [performance.metrics](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/config-gerrit.html#performance.metric.operation)
to record latency and counts od specific operations.

Please bear in mind that the above metrics can quickly build up in number, eventually increasing the
latency and the size of collecting metrics payloads via to monitoring such as `prometheus`.

## Important Notes

## Known issues

* [Issue 376085315](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/376085315):
  Warnings display about `Unsupported class file major version 65` when loading plugins.

  A critical issue has been found during the testing of `rc1`, which affects the loading of plugins compiled with
  `Java21`. A fix is now pending with [Change 440701](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/440701) and it
  will be fixed in `rc2`.

### Schema and index changes

No changes to either the schema or indexes versions.

### Online index schema upgrade from 3.10

If you’re upgrading from `3.10`, the Lucene index does not need any rebuild.
If you’re upgrading from `3.9`, the Lucene index is automatically rebuilt upon Gerrit startup after
the upgrade.

However, if you’re upgrading from `3.8` or an earlier version, you must use the Offline
upgrade steps below, because of the Lucene upgrade mentioned in the
`3.8` [release notes](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.10.html#schema-and-index-changes).

### Offline upgrade

- Download the new `gerrit.war`
- Stop Gerrit
- Backup the existing indexes in case a rollback is required
- Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
- Run init `java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch`
- If you are upgrading from a `3.9`/`3.10` versions you don’t need to run reindex
  (see `Online index schema upgrade from 3.10` above).

  If you are upgrading from a `3.8` or an earlier version, you must run a reindex
  of all indexes:

  `java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path`

  See the
  [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.11.0/pgm-reindex.html)
  command for other options.

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.11.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.10 when configured
using either
[high-availability](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
or
[multi-site](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/multi-site/+/refs/heads/master/README.md)
setup.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users will not experience any
outage or service disruption and will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation seamlessly.

The zero-downtime upgrade process for high-availability or multi-site setups
consists of the following steps ([demo](https://youtu.be/vK5qsb0W7q4)):

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.9 or v3.10 in high-availability or multi-site
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set one of the Gerrit servers to unhealthy.
3. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.11.x and start Gerrit again.
4. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
5. Ensure the Gerrit server is fully caught up with the events that happened while
   it was down before directing traffic to it.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for each of the remaining Gerrit servers.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to Gerrit v3.9 or v3.10 release is possible, but requires the following
manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.9 or v3.10 version
3. Init Gerrit

  ```sh
    java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
  ```

4. Startup Gerrit server

## Security Fixes

* [Change 435557](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435557):
  Add Option to set HttpOnly flag for cookies.

  This option helps to prevent possible XSS-attacks.

* [Change 435998](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435998):
  Change default of auth.cookieHttpOnly to true.

  This makes the `auth.cookieHttpOnly` cookie more secure by default as there should usually be no
  need to allow client side javascript to access it.

* [Change 435960](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435960):
  Don't allow discovery of non-visible groups.

  A user could have used the `ls-members` command to distinguish between a non-existent group and an
  existent but not visible group. This fixes that.

### Breaking Changes

* [Change 422518](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422518):
  Record duration of performance events in nanos (instead of in millis).

  Performance events shorter than `1ms` were being recorded with a duration of `0ms`, causing them
  to be invisible on performance charts and making it unclear whether they were executed or just too
  fast to be displayed.

* [Change 434037](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/434037):
  Disallowed tracing configs that trigger tracing for too many requests

  When using a `tracing.<trace-id>` subsection in `gerrit.config` one must now specify at least one
  of `requestUriPattern`, `account` and `projectPattern`, or otherwise it is ignored.

* [Change 429818](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429818),
  [Change 429819](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429819)
  and [Change 429820](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429820):
  Removed etags for `change`, `revision` and `ListFiles` resources.

  Any REST clients built expecting that ETags exist and that rely on them for workflows, may require
  modifications.

### Breaking Changes - Replication plugin

* [Change 430660](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/430660) Prevent replication plugin start
  with invalid remotes:

  Allow the Gerrit admin to detect early a configuration issue with the remotes. Upon invalid
  remotes configuration the plugin will not start and an error will be thrown:
  `Unable to start replication plugin because remote`.

* [Issue 320715545](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/320715545) Use SecureStore for
  reading username/password credentials

  Use SecureStore for reading username/password credentials. Existing installations may have
  used a mix of encrypted and clear text credentials in `secure.config`, leveraging the replication
  plugin bug that was not accessing it using the correct API. Introduce a legacy feature flag
  `gerrit.useLegacyCredentials` that allow the Gerrit admin to still use the legacy mode.

### New Features

* [Change 409734](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/409734):
  New REST API endpoint for deactivating stale accounts.

  You can now `POST /config/server/deactivate.stale.accounts` to trigger account deactivation
  outside the time window scheduled in `gerrit.config`.

* [Change 421120](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/421120):
  A `Blocked Users` group that allows admin to block spammers is created automatically during the
  site initialisation.

  This change makes it easier to block spamming users by automatically creating the `Blocked Users`
  group with the `BLOCK` read permissions on `refs/*`. All admins need to do to block users is
  adding them to the group.

* [Issue 317351858](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/317351858):
  Submitting changes with unresolved comments is blocked for new sites by default

* [Change 420300](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/420300):
  Added REST API to clean old changes.

  You can now `POST /config/server/cleanup.changes` to abandon changes older than some given time
  outside the time window scheduled in `gerrit.config`.

* [Change 247812](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/247812)
  and [Change 248034](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/248034):
  Added support for plugins to block WorkQueue tasks without depriving other tasks of a thread.

  Introduces a `TaskParker` interface allowing selective task parking to control resource usage by
  deprioritizing certain tasks without blocking other tasks from using resources.

  Tasks blocked from running by `TaskParker` implementations show their state as `parked`.

* [Change 425478](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425478):
  Support multiple parents in the `Get Patch` API.

  Now the "Get Patch" API can handle a new `parent` flag to select which parent to use to generate
  the patch.

* [Change 426018](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/426018):
  Added highlight support for the `epp` language.

* [Change 425804](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425804):
  Added REST API endpoint for creating project config change.

  Similar to the `access:review` endpoint, this allows creating a change for project configuration
  updates via REST API by `PUT /projects/myproject/config:review`.

* [Change 425805](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425805):
  Added REST API endpoint for creating a change for labels update.

  Allows CRUD operations on multiple label definitions in this project at once by
  `POST /projects/myproject/labels:review`.

* [Change 425806](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425806):
  Added REST API endpoints for batch updating submit requirements.

  Introduced two new endpoints for updating submit requirements. One for updating without a review:
  `POST /projects/myproject/submit_requirements/` Another for creating a change for the update:
  `POST /projects/myproject/submit_requirements:review`.

* [Change 425525](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425525):
  Added API option to apply patches that conflict.

  `POST /changes/{change-id}/patch:apply` now takes a payload that allows an optional
  `allow_conflicts` field, to tolerate conflicts and add conflict markers where required.

* [Change 425807](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425807):
  Added a new config for protecting project config from unreviewed updates.

  When `gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate` is set to `true`, all attempts to update a project
  config directly using any REST API are rejected. Instead, users should always use APIs which
  create a config change (for review).

* [Change 425808](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/425808):
  `Save for review` button was added into the project config page.

  When `gerrit.requireChangeForConfigUpdate` is set to `true` a new `Save for review` is added to
  the project config page.

* [Change 429017](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429017):
  Introduce `@DynamicItem.Final` for allowing immutable dynamic bindings of interfaces to
  implementations in other plugins.

* [Change 429823](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/429823):
  Add `TRIVIAL_REBASE_WITH_MESSAGE_UPDATE` ChangeKind to allow automatic vote copy in this case.

  Introduce a new ChangeKind type representing a conflict-free merge between the new parent and the
  prior patch set but having a commit message update.

* [Change 439642](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/439642):
  Report number of documents in the indexes REST API.

  This can be useful to observe index size, especially while a new index version is being created.

* [Change 438704](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438704):
  `LockManager` as an extension point.

  Provides a mechanism for global locks in distributed setups. This allows implementing global
  locking beyond project creation, such as ensuring only one Gerrit server runs certain tasks at a
  time (e.g. aut-abandoning, git-gc, account-deactivation and so forth).

* [Change 439124](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/439124):
  Allow applying fixes to different patchsets.

  The `Apply Provided Fix` API now supports applying fixes to older patchsets, enabling users to
  apply fixes not just to the current patchset.

* [Change 438424](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438424):
  Add support for `Vue` code highlighting.

* [Change 437343](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/437343):
  Added screen to browse the server info.

  Users can find important properties of the server listed in a new server info page.

* [Change 436218](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436218):
  Added extension point that allows plugins to provide server metadata.

* [Change 436318](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436318):
  Allow admins to get the account state of other users via REST API.

* [Issue 435999](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435999):
  Add method `resolveExactIgnoreVisibility` for `AccountResolver`.

  This method can be used by plugins to be able to Ignore Visibility when doing exact resolving of
  an account.

* [Change 435937](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435937):
  Added extension point that allows plugins to provide account state metadata.

  Provide an extension point that enables plugins to supply additional data for account states which
  are returned from the `Get Account State` REST endpoint.

* [Change 435819](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435819):
  Added REST endpoint to retrieve the account state with a single request.

  The new `GET /accounts/link:#account-id/self/state` can now be used Retrieves the superset of all
  information related to an account, including its permissions.

* [Change 435559](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435559):
  For users that have the 'View Access' global capability return ACL info when request is rejected
  due to a permission issue.

* [Change 435017](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435017):
  Plugin provided `change-metadata-items` can be placed above `submit-requirements`.

  With this change, plugins can choose to place items above the submit requirements.

* [Change 433022](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/433022):
  Added support for configurable performance metrics.

  A new `performance.metric` configuration section can be used in `gerrit.config` to specify
  operations
  for latency and count recording in performance metrics. This is useful to identify slow operations
  and assess the impact of optimizations.

* [Change 431638](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/431638):
  Added metric to count rejected pushes.

  The new `receivecommits/reject_count` set of metrics count the number of rejected pushes. They are
  suffixed with the push kind (either `direct`, for direct pushes, or `magic`, for pushes to magic
  refs) and with the reason of the rejection (e.g. `branch_not_found`, `no_new_changes`, and so
  forth), for example: `receivecommits_reject_count_magic_branch_for_main_not_found`,
  `receivecommits_reject_count_direct_prohibited_by_Gerrit:_not_permitted:_create`.

* [Issue 321784728](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/321784728):
  Add support for using subsections in `passwd`.

  Fixes a bug whereby the `java -jar bin/gerrit.war passwd` program couldn't be used to set a
  subsection config, such as `remote.instance.username`.

### Performance improvements

* [Change 422522](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422522):
  Avoid double loading of change notes when retrieving change without specifying a meta rev ID.

* [Change 426537](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/426537):
  Improve performance of changes queries when using the custom permission backends.

  The virtual host module, or other permissions backends, can potentially restrict the visibility of
  users to a limited set of projects or changes.

* [Issue 365254275](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/365254275):
  Don't sync bulk actions details for anonymous user.

  This change effectively reduces potential system load and improves overall performance by
  preventing anonymous users calls from loading unnecessary data.

### Bug fixes

* [Change 422039](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/422039):
  Fix Cloud Spanner error codes for AccountPatchReviewStore.

* [Change 438861](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/438861):
  Fixed ls-projects to skip corrupted repositories.

  The `ls-projects` command now logs an error and continues processing other projects if a
  `MissingObjectException` occurs due to a corrupted Git repository, rather than stopping execution
  entirely.

* [Change 437821](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/437821):
  Fixed `GET /auth-check.svg` error.

* [Change 436057](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/436057):
  Fixed exception in GetMessage REST endpoint when the change contained multiple footers with the
  same key.

  Only the last footer for any footer key is now returned.

* [Change 435938](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/435938):
  `AccountResolver:resolveExact` can now resolve accounts for usernames.

  `AccountResolver:resolveExact` now supports resolving accounts by exact username matches, avoiding
  unintended results from fuzzy matching.

* [Change 434177](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/434177):
  Disallowed ref creation when passed object is neither Commit nor a Tag.

  Restrict ref creation to only `Commit` or `Tag` objects, preventing unintended ref creation for
  unsupported object types.

   ```

  Notable changes are:

    * `4f43f5d` Print hook stdout/stderr in case of a non-zero exit code:

      Hook output is now printed when a non-zero exit code occurs, providing error details without
      requiring DEBUG logging level.

    * `41c3ad1` Resolve relative hooks.path against $site_path, not cwd of the process

      Relative paths for `hooks.path` are now resolved against `$site_path` instead of the process's
      working directory, ensuring consistent path resolution.

* plugin-manager updated to `86f7ec61a9785df246f653a1336520b9607399b1`:

   ```shell
   git log --no-merges --abbrev-commit --format=oneline cdd2d2d69666a70a16ac02bacf8e7fbbf4ca9979..86f7ec61a9785df246f653a1336520b9607399b1

   ```

  Notable changes are:

    * `5cfb07a` synchronizePendingEvents: Fix stuck replaying flag:

      Fixed an issue where exceptions during task accumulation could cause the replaying flag to
      become
      stuck, potentially blocking future distributor runs.

    * `660fcd4` Destination: use striped lock to reduce lock contention.

      Optimized replication throughput by implementing striped locks in the Destination to reduce
      lock
      contention across repositories.

    * `3982574` Fix FanoutConfigurationResource update API:

      This fixes [issue 351843807](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/351843807) where
      Gerrit
      changes were no longer syncing to `Github`.

    * `eac5d4e` Delay the fetching of credentials until push time:

      Improved replication reliability by delaying credential fetching until push time, allowing
      dynamically reloaded credentials to be applied even for retried replication tasks.

    * `69c66c8` Improve FanoutConfigurationResource loading performance:

      Enhanced loading performance of replication remotes as individual files (under
      `$GERRIT_SITE/etc/replication`) by optimizing remote parsing and merging logic, reducing load
      times for large configurations.
