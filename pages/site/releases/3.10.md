## Release highlights

### Rebase merge commits

It's now possible to rebase merge commits directly from the UI.

### Further improve Suggest Fixes

It's now possible to have plugin generated suggested fixes directly in the
UI. This opens the door for AI integration in the review process with Gerrit
Code Review.

Please see more details
[here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-suggest-edits.html)

### Import changes from other servers

Imported projects from other servers is now fully supported, including also
queries by change number on Lucene.

### List enabled features/experiments via REST API

It's now possible to list all experiments currently enabled on a Gerrit server
by hitting the `config/server/experiments` endpoint. Please see more details
[here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-config.html#list-experiments)

### Index management is now more accessible

A number of rest endpoints have been added to simplify management and
observability of Gerrit indexes. It's now possible to:
- [List
  indexes](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-config.html#list-indexes)
- [Get a
  index](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-config.html#_get_index),
  along side information on it's version.
- [Create
  snapshots](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-config.html#snapshot-index)
  of the index. These can then be used as backups of the index.
- [Re-index an index
  version](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-config.html#_reindex_an_index_version).
  It is also possible to specify whether to re-use up-to-date index documents.

### Less email notifications

Attention has been put on reducing the number of email notifications that Gerrit
users receive even when no actions need to be taken.

- Gerrit no longer send emails to everyone when additional reviewers or CCs are
  added. Please note, this is also a breaking change, see more details on the
  change, [Change 400822](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/400822).

- Only add owner and uploader to the attention set if the label is copied over to
the latest patchset, avoiding emails for votes on older patchsets that don't
affect the latest one. The reason for the user being in the attention set is
also automatically updated.

- Stop always cc'ing all "reviewers by email", as otherwise they receive more
emails than intended.

### Support project~changeNumber when querying for changes

So far querying changes using the `change:` predicate did not
allow to use the `project~changeNumber` format. However, since
[Change 387794](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/387794)
this is the default ID format returned in the ChangeInfo. Being able to
use it directly for further queries would be advantageous.

i.e. `https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/q/change:gerrit~399319`

This reinforces the concept that `project~changeNumber` should be the Id to
use when trying to unique identify changes. This should be preferred to
`project~branch~changeId` as this can theoretically contain duplicates, as
specified in [Issue 313935024](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/313935024)

### Configurable H2 cache pruning

Schedule of cache pruning of H2 caches is now configurable. This means that it
doesn't necessarily need to run on startup, therefore improving Gerrit startup
times. Find more information in the
[docs](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#cachePruning).

### Improved H2 Cache performances

Indexes have been added to the H2 cache databases, greatly improving performance
of persistent caches, especially pruning and building bloom filters.

### Allow fixes in Human comments via Rest API

Robot Comments have been officially deprecated for some time and the [checks API
framework](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/pg-plugin-checks-api.html)
is recommended since Gerrit 3.6. This is great as it provides a way of
greatly reducing the size of the repository. However, unlike fixes
suggested in Robot-Comments, Human Suggested fixes could not be applied
programmatically, until now.

Gerrit 3.10 introduces a way of suggesting fixes that could then be
programmatically applied with the the [Apply Stored
Fixes](https://review.gerrithub.io/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#apply-stored-fix)
endpoint.
This is done by adding an extra field `fix_suggestions` in
[CommentInfo](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#comment-info)
that will be stored separately on NoteDB.

We don't consider this a breaking change as the comment info payload is
serialized as JSON and unknown fields should be ignore when parsing such data
format. To be extra cautious, this field is only written if the experiment is
enabled.

The experiment can be enabled in `gerrit.config` like so
```
[experiments]
          enabled = GerritBackendFeature__allow_fix_suggestions_in_comments
 ```

### Native log deletion
So far Gerrit admins have always needed to rely on external tools to delete old
logs files, now this feature is brought within Gerrit itself and made easily
configurable. See more details under
[log.timeToKeep](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html)

### Support for secondary emails
It's now possible to update the commit message with a secondary email, both in
the UI and via Rest API.

### Update author and committer from the UI
It's now possible to update the author and the committer identities directly in
the UI.

## Important Notes
* [Change 394841](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/394841):
The commit-msg hook now operates as a no-op for temporary commits, which
are identified by a lowercase word followed by an exclamation mark (e.g.,
fixup!, squash!).

  Configure gerrit.createChangeId to 'always' to force creation on these cases.
* [Change 394841](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/418257) Introduce
  server_id in change_notes cache and update its version number.

  This means that if you're using the change_notes cache, the file needs to be
  deleted. It will be automatically regenerated.

### Submit Requirement Changes
* [Change 396517](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/396517) allow a
  max_count = 50 for label predicates for SRs.
* [Issue 325070428](https://crbug.com/gerrit/325070428) Fixed PostReview to not
  execute the submit rules twice when the SUBMIT_REQUIREMENTS or SUBMITTABLE
  options were requested

### Schema and index changes

The `accounts` index version has been increased to version 14. The `changes`
index version has been increased to version 86. The `groups` index version has
been increased to version 11. The `projects` index version has been increased to
version 9.

The schema version hasn't been updated, however, because Lucen was bumped 2
versions from 7.x to 9.8 the upgrade is supported only from Gerrit v3.9, as
Lucene libraries do not support more than one version upgrade at a time.

### Online index schema upgrade from 3.9
By default, if you’re upgrading from 3.9, the index is automatically rebuilt
upon Gerrit startup after the upgrade.

If you’re upgrading from 3.8 or an earlier version, you must use the Offline
upgrade steps below, because of the Lucene upgrade mentioned above.

### Offline upgrade
- Download the new gerrit.war
- Stop Gerrit
- Ensure all installed plugins are compatible with the new API
- Run init `java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch`
- Reindex if you are upgrading from a 3.9 versions you don’t need to run reindex
  (see Online index schema upgrade from 3.9 above). If you still want to you
  will need to run reindex:

  `java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path` If you are upgrading from a 3.8 or
  an earlier version, you must run a reindex of all indexes:

  `java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path` See the
  [reindex](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.9.0/pgm-reindex.html)
  command for other options.

### Downgrade
 Downgrade to any Gerrit v3.9 release is possible, but requires the following
manual steps:

1. Shutdown all migrated Gerrit servers
2. Update the gerrit.war and plugins to the previous v3.7/v3.8 version
3. Run offline change reindexing using the previous gerrit.war version

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path --batch
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
```

4. Startup Gerrit server

### Native packaging
Updated almalinux to 9.3.

### Breaking Changes

* [Change 409738](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/409738):
Added validation for label copy conditions

* [Change 407417](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/407417):
Branch links in change metadata now ignore status

  This means that clicking the branch link in the change detail section returns
  all changes associated with that branch, rather than the ones matching the
  change's status. This will return a much greater number of changes than
  before, potentially impacting plugin/workflow performance.

* [Change 404717](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/404717):
Deprecate review command without project argument

* [Issue 325070428](https://crbug.com/gerrit/325070428) Added new
`current_revision_number` field to ChangeInfo that contains the current
patch set number

  If the consumer is "well designed" adding one extra field in the JSON response
  should not break any existing behaviour. However, as it's a change in the
  response payload, we're highlighting this as potentially breaking change.

* [Change 400821](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/400821):
`AutoMerger#lookupFromGitOrMergeInMemory`: Remove mergeStrategy parameter

  This only impacts plugins.

* [Change 401198](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/401198) DiffOperations:
Remove unused diffOptions parameter from load methods

  Potentially breaking change as it impacts plugins that use the DiffOperations
  interface.

* [Deprecated robot-comments](#deprecated-robot-comments)

* [Change 401977](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/401977):
Use `RetryScheduler` with backoff when server returns 429

  Gerrit UI will now automatically retry the Rest API calls to the backend when
  the HTTP status code is 429. This could lead to duplicated requests sent to
  the backend and consequently higher load on the system.

* [Change 396859](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/396859):
Disable dropdown items for downlading files >50 MB

  The 50MB limit is hardcoded and cannot be changed via configuration.

* [Change 400622](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/400622):
`PluginCommandModule` requires the plugin name in its constructor, hence all plugins
that expose SSH commands need amending with an explicit constructor like
the following:

  ```java
  class MySshModule extends PluginCommandModule {

    @Inject
    MySshModule(@PluginName String pluginName) {
      super(pluginName);
    }
  }
  ```

Remove ActionType, ChangeActions and RevisionActions enums forwarded as
properties from ChangeActionsPluginApi implementation

* [Issue 240676565](https://crbug.com/gerrit/240676565):
Reviewer updates for reviewers by email are returned in change details
