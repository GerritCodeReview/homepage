Documentation: **[3.7.0](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.7.0/index.html)**

## Release highlights

### UI mostly migrated to [Lit](https://lit.dev/)

Gerrit UI is mostly migrated to Lit, with a
[few exceptions for certain modules](https://github.com/GerritCodeReview/gerrit/search?q=polymer).

### Mention @user support

Users can be mentioned in comments using the `@<user>` notation and select the matching
accounts. Mentioning users automatically add them in CC and send e-mail notification to
get their attention.

This feature can be enabled in `gerrit.config` by adding this configuration:

```sh
[experiments]
    enabled = UiFeature__mention_users
```

### Full markdown support in comments

Comments and checks accept and render the full markdown syntax, allowing richer
interaction and communication between authors and reviewers. This follows the
CommonMark spec, except inline images and direct HTML are not rendered and kept
as plaintext. No markdown rendering is done in the commit message.

This feature can be enabled in `gerrit.config` by adding this configuration:

```sh
[experiments]
    enabled = UiFeature__render_markdown
```

### Bulk actions on search results and dashboard

Apply a change action to an entire group of changes all at once right from the
search page or your dashboard. Simply select all the changes, click your action,
and fill out the details on the dialog. Currently supported actions are:

- Add Reviewer or CC
- Add Topic
- Add Hashtag
- Vote (excluding Code-Review)

### Auto theme mode

The theme is automatically changed to light/dark based on your OS preference. You can change the
theme in users preferences.

### Copy links

The copy links are in the dropdown next to the change number with keyboard shortcuts or a button
to quickly copy the format that you prefer to link change.

### Import of Projects and Changes from other Gerrit servers

Gerrit can read and render Changes coming from Projects copied from other servers having
different server-ids and account-ids.

### New command to check project access for other users

Gerrit admins can verify the ACLs of projects for individual users using the new
`gerrit check-project-access` SSH command.

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

This release contain changes to the schema which is upgraded to version 185; also all indexes
have been upgraded.

### Offline upgrade

Download the gerrit.war and run the `init` and then `reindex` program:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
```

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.7.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.6.3 or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

> NOTE: Gerrit versions older than v3.6.0 would require an offline upgrade.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.6.3 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.
3. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.7.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to Gerrit v3.6.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.7.x server
2. Downgrade the All-Projects.git version (refname: `refs/meta/version`) to `184`:
   ``` sh
   git update-ref refs/meta/version $(echo -n 184|git hash-object -w --stdin)
   ```
   See [git hash-object](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) and
   [git update-ref](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-ref).

   > NOTE: The migration of the __label config to copy-condition__ performed in v3.7.x init
   > step is idempotent and can be run many times. Also v3.6.x supports the copy-condition and
   > therefore the migration does not need to be downgraded.

3. Run Gerrit v3.6.x init, downgrading all plugins, and run the off-line reindex

   ```sh
     java -jar gerrit-3.6.x.war init -d site_path
     java -jar gerrit-3.6.x.war reindex -d site_path
   ```
4. Start Gerrit v3.6.x server

### Breaking changes

* [Change 343774](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343774):
Delete ignored state of changes and 'star:' queries

  The query predicates `star:ignored`, `is:ignored` and `star:star` are not supported
  anymore. The latter is identical to 'is:starred' or 'has:star'.

* [Change 334467](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/334467):
Removed support for deprecated approval config fields in label configs

  The boolean flags in label configurations to control approval copying,
  as well as the copyValue settings, was previously deprecated and now completely
  removed in flavor of the new copyCondition setting that allows to express the
  copy conditions as a query.

* [Change 337456](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337456):
Ban new modifications to label functions in favour of submit requirements

* [Issue 15784](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15784):
New project `head updated` event in the stream events

* [Issue 11686](https://crbug.com/gerrit/11686):
Discontinue support for legacy numeric types in Lucene

  In Lucene the implementation switched from integer id to string id and now
  all the old code is removed. Three different index implementations
  are affected:

  * changes
  * account
  * groups

* [Change 334325](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/334325):
Migrated label definitions to use copy conditions instead of deprecated fields

  The boolean flags in label configurations to control approval copying,
  as well as the copyValue settings, have been deprecated in favor of the
  new copyCondition setting that allows to express the copy conditions as
  a query. The newly added schema version migrates the deprecated fields to copy
  conditions.

  **NOTE**: Because of this breaking change, downgrading to Gerrit v3.6.x is
  not possible out of the box.

* [Issue 15941](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15941):
Fix SSH queries to not show commit-message unless --commit-message is provided

  This issue has existed for several years and should be considered
  breaking as users might expect commit message to be included by
  default in SSH query results.
  Obtaining the commit message is a costly operation as the commit
  data has to be loaded. So, showing it even when --commit-message
  is not provided degrades the performance of SSH queries.

* [Change 336297](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336297):
Recognize lower case operators in search

  Previously, we only recognized AND, OR and NOT as boolean
  operators. This seems overly strict as users might
  unintentionally use the lower case variants.

### Indexing improvements

* [Change 343798](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343798):
Introduce `index.pageSizeMultiplier` configuration to paginate index
queries with increasing size

* [Change 343694](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343694):

Introduce `index.paginationType=SEARCH_AFTER` configuration for speeding up
query pagination

* [Change 349694](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/349694):
Improve performance of parentof operator by two orders of magnitude

* [Change 345634](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/345634):
Paginate internal change index queries, as index backends such as Lucene
and Elasticsearch are known to degrade with a high limit

### Performance fixes

* [Change 338154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338154):
Lazy load change notes when submit by push
  Improves performance of change submit via push

* [Change 338574](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338574):
Cache ProjectControl instances in SSH queries
  A PerThreadCache is used to cache ProjectControl instances to
  improve SSH query performance.

* [Change 338614](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338614)

Support bulk actions on dashboard and search pages

* [Change 337434](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337434):
New REST API for previewing fix from the request body to a patch set

  The newly added API `fix:preview` previewes fix(es) provided as part
  of a POST request body. `ApplyProvidedFixInput` holds the fix(es).
  This flow is suitable when a frontend plugin shows fix(es) that it is
  suggesting on the UI and that the user can accept. 

* [Change 339788](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/339788):
Allow testing submit requirements using a pending change to the refs/meta/config branch

  Admins can then test their SRs using the following workflow:
  1. Upload a pending change to the refs/meta/config branch.
  2. Test it immediately on any change using:
     `curl -X POST  https://<gerrit-url>/changes/<change_to_test>/check.submit_requirement?sr-name=Foo&refs-config-change-id=$id`

* [Change 336715](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336715):

  posted on patch set creation. This allows users to find the copied/outdated
  approvals for each patch set in the change log.

* [Change 337968](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337968):
Copy approvals that are applied on outdated patch sets to follow-up patch sets if copyable

  Copying approvals that are applied on outdated patch sets to follow-up
  patch sets make the life easier for CIs, e.g.:
