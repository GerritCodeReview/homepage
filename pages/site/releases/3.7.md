## Release highlights

### UI mostly migrated to [Lit](https://lit.dev/)

Gerrit UI is mostly migrated to Lit, with a
[few exceptions for certain modules](https://github.com/GerritCodeReview/gerrit/search?q=polymer).

### Mention @user support

Users can be mentioned in comments using the `@<user>` notation and select the matching
accounts. Mentioning users automatically add them in CC and send e-mail notification to
get their attention.

This feature can be enabled in `gerrit.config` by adding this configuration:

```sh
[experiments]
    enabled = UiFeature__mention_users
```

### Full markdown support in comments

Comments and checks accept and render the full markdown syntax, allowing richer
interaction and communication between authors and reviewers. This follows the
CommonMark spec, except inline images and direct HTML are not rendered and kept
as plaintext. No markdown rendering is done in the commit message.

### Bulk actions on search results and dashboard

Apply a change action to an entire group of changes all at once right from the
search page or your dashboard. Simply select all the changes, click your action,
and fill out the details on the dialog. Currently supported actions are:

- Add Reviewer or CC
- Add Topic
- Add Hashtag
- Vote (excluding Code-Review)

### Auto theme mode

The theme is automatically changed to light/dark based on your OS preference. You can change the
theme in users preferences.

### Copy links

The copy links are in the dropdown next to the change number with keyboard shortcuts or a button
to quickly copy the format that you prefer to link change.

### Import Projects' Changes from other Gerrit servers

Gerrit can read and render Changes coming from Projects copied from other servers having
different server-ids and account-ids.
This allows the Gerrit administrators to move projects and changes across servers with
a compatible NoteDb structure and having the change meta-data parsed and reindexed in
Gerrit.

> NOTE: Only the changes can be imported and reindexed in Gerrit, following the account
> reverse lookup association using the new `imported` external-ids. Groups, ACLs and project
> hierarchy and Prolog rules (aka `refs/meta/config`) may not be imported out of the box
> and still require the Gerrit administrator to copy and adapt them manually.

At high-level, the process consists of:

1. Configure the [`gerrit.importedServerId`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.7.0/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.importedServerId)
   with the values of the [`gerrit.serverId`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.7.0/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.serverId)
   of the Gerrit servers from the project changes to be imported originate from.

2. Identify the accounts involved in the project changes to import and create
   the corresponding [`imported` external-ids]() in the `All-Users.git` repository.

   Example of how to add the external-id `imported:1000002@59a4964e-6376-4ed9-beef-123bd9217df8`
   to the account-id `1000001`:

   ```
   $ EXT_ID=imported:1000002@59a4964e-6376-4ed9-beef-123bd9217df8
   $ EXT_ID_NOTE=$(echo -n $EXT_ID | shasum | awk '{print $1}')
   $ git clone $GERRIT_SITE/git/All-Users.git && cd All-Users
   $ git fetch origin refs/meta/external-ids && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
   $ echo -e '[externalId "'$EXT_ID'"]\n\taccountId = 1000001' > $EXT_ID_NOTE
   $ git commit -am "Added $EXT_ID"
   $ git push origin HEAD:refs/meta/external-ids
   ```

3. Create the destination project of the import in Gerrit

4. Push the changes under `refs/changes/*` from the source Gerrit into the newly created
   destination project.

5. Reindex all imported changes, either online with
   [`gerrit index changes`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.7.0/cmd-index-changes.html)
   or offline with the [`java -jar gerrit.war reindex`](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/3.7.0/pgm-reindex.html)
   commands.

The overall process has been described in detail and live demoed during the
[Gerrit User Summit 2022](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/summit/2022/+/refs/heads/master/sessions/import-gerrit-projects-across-servers.md).

### New command to check project access for other users

Gerrit admins can verify the ACLs of projects for individual users using the new
`gerrit check-project-access` SSH command.

## Important notes

### Schema and index changes

This release contain changes to the schema which is upgraded to version 185; also all indexes
have been upgraded.

### Offline upgrade

Download the gerrit.war and run the `init` and then `reindex` program:

```sh
  java -jar gerrit.war init -d site_path
  java -jar gerrit.war reindex -d site_path
```

### Online upgrade with zero-downtime

Gerrit v3.7.x supports zero-downtime upgrade from Gerrit v3.6.3 or later when
configured using a [high-availability configuration](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/high-availability/+/refs/heads/master/README.md),
and the Git repositories are stored in a shared filesystem such as NFS or
similar.

> NOTE: Gerrit versions older than v3.6.0 would require an offline upgrade.

During the zero-downtime upgrade, Gerrit end-users would not notice any outage
or service disruption. They will be able to perform any read/write Gerrit
operation on the GUI or using using any API.

The zero-downtime upgrade consists of the following steps:

1. Have Gerrit servers running v3.6.3 or later, in high-availability
   configuration, healthy and able to handle the incoming traffic properly.
2. Set `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` to `true` in `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.
3. Set the Gerrit server unhealthy.
4. Shutdown the Gerrit server, update gerrit.war and plugins to v3.7.x and start
   Gerrit again.
5. Verify that the Gerrit server is working properly (e.g. run automated smoke
   tests) and then make it healthy again.
6. Wait for the Gerrit server to start serving traffic normally.
7. Repeat steps 3. to 6. for all the other Gerrit servers.
8. Remove `gerrit.experimentalRollingUpgrade` from `gerrit.config` on both Gerrit masters.

### Downgrade

Downgrade to Gerrit v3.6.x release is possible, but requires the following manual steps:

1. Shutdown a migrated Gerrit v3.7.x server
2. Downgrade the All-Projects.git version (refname: `refs/meta/version`) to `184`:
   ``` sh
   git update-ref refs/meta/version $(echo -n 184|git hash-object -w --stdin)
   ```
   See [git hash-object](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-hash-object) and
   [git update-ref](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-ref).

   > NOTE: The migration of the __label config to copy-condition__ performed in v3.7.x init
   > step is idempotent and can be run many times. Also v3.6.x supports the copy-condition and
   > therefore the migration does not need to be downgraded.

3. Run Gerrit v3.6.x init, downgrading all plugins, and run the off-line reindex

   ```sh
     java -jar gerrit-3.6.x.war init -d site_path
     java -jar gerrit-3.6.x.war reindex -d site_path
   ```
4. Start Gerrit v3.6.x server

### Native packaging

    [DockerHub Gerrit images](https://hub.docker.com/r/gerritcodereview/gerrit/tags?page=1&name=3.7.0)
    include images for arm64 architecture.

### Update gerrit.reportBugUrl configuration

The issues of the Gerrit Code Review project have been migrated from
Monorail into the new Gerrit Tracker, see announcement at:
https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss/c/F4havFh_Bvw/m/D5MsV17yAgAJ

If the [gerrit.reportBugUrl](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.reportBugUrl)
setting on your Gerrit server is pointing to the Gerrit Monorail project, which
is deprecated now, please update the URL to point to the new Gerrit Tracker,
e.g. change https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/entry?template=Bug+Report
to https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/new.

### Breaking changes

* [Change 335625](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/335625):
ThreadMXBeanSun: Use getCurrentThreadAllocatedBytes() method

  Used Bazel version is shipping latest release of JDK 11, that contains this method.
  The `getCurrentThreadAllocatedBytes()` method is provided from JDK versions
  >= 11.0.10.
  Make sure you are running JDK versions >= 11.0.10 when upgrading to 3.7.

* [Change 343774](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343774):
Delete ignored state of changes and 'star:' queries

  The query predicates `star:ignored`, `is:ignored` and `star:star` are not supported
  anymore. The latter is identical to 'is:starred' or 'has:star'.

* [Change 334467](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/334467):
Removed support for deprecated approval config fields in label configs

  The boolean flags in label configurations to control approval copying,
  as well as the copyValue settings, was previously deprecated and now completely
  removed in flavor of the new copyCondition setting that allows to express the
  copy conditions as a query.

* [Change 337456](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337456):
Ban new modifications to label functions in favour of submit requirements

* [Issue 15784](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15784):
New project `head updated` event in the stream events

* [Issue 11686](https://crbug.com/gerrit/11686):
Discontinue support for legacy numeric types in Lucene

  In Lucene the implementation switched from integer id to string id and now
  all the old code is removed. Three different index implementations
  are affected:

  * changes
  * account
  * groups

* [Change 334325](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/334325):
Migrated label definitions to use copy conditions instead of deprecated fields

  The boolean flags in label configurations to control approval copying,
  as well as the copyValue settings, have been deprecated in favor of the
  new copyCondition setting that allows to express the copy conditions as
  a query. The newly added schema version migrates the deprecated fields to copy
  conditions.

  **NOTE**: Because of this breaking change, downgrading to Gerrit v3.6.x is
  not possible out of the box.

* [Issue 15941](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15941):
Fix SSH queries to not show commit-message unless --commit-message is provided

  This issue has existed for several years and should be considered
  breaking as users might expect commit message to be included by
  default in SSH query results.
  Obtaining the commit message is a costly operation as the commit
  data has to be loaded. So, showing it even when --commit-message
  is not provided degrades the performance of SSH queries.

* [Change 336297](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336297):
Recognize lower case operators in search

  Previously, we only recognized AND, OR and NOT as boolean
  operators. This seems overly strict as users might
  unintentionally use the lower case variants.

### Indexing improvements

* [Change 343798](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343798):
Introduce `index.pageSizeMultiplier` configuration to paginate index
queries with increasing size

* [Change 343694](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343694):
Improve performance of queries that check the visibility of changes for
a non-current user

* [Change 343096](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/343096):
Introduce `index.paginationType=SEARCH_AFTER` configuration for speeding up
query pagination

* [Change 349694](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/349694):
Improve performance of parentof operator by two orders of magnitude

* [Change 345634](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/345634):
Paginate internal change index queries, as index backends such as Lucene
and Elasticsearch are known to degrade with a high limit

### Performance fixes

* [Change 338154](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338154):
Lazy load change notes when submit by push
  Improves performance of change submit via push

* [Change 338574](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338574):
Cache ProjectControl instances in SSH queries
  A PerThreadCache is used to cache ProjectControl instances to
  improve SSH query performance.

* [Change 338614](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338614)
Optimize SSH queries to avoid loading individual accounts
  This improves performance of SSH queries.

* [Change 338834](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338834):
Avoid creating an IdentifiedUser multiple times in a SSH query
  This improves performance of SSH queries.

* [Change 339795](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/339795):
Improve performance of the create branch REST API when the repository
contains over one million refs

* [Issue 16284](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16284):
Fix performance issues with git-upload-pack on repositories with a large number
of changes

Support bulk actions on dashboard and search pages

* [Change 337434](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337434):
New REST API for previewing fix from the request body to a patch set

  The newly added API `fix:preview` previewes fix(es) provided as part
  of a POST request body. `ApplyProvidedFixInput` holds the fix(es).
  This flow is suitable when a frontend plugin shows fix(es) that it is
  suggesting on the UI and that the user can accept.

* [Change 339788](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/339788):
Allow testing submit requirements using a pending change to the refs/meta/config branch

  Admins can then test their SRs using the following workflow:
  1. Upload a pending change to the refs/meta/config branch.
  2. Test it immediately on any change using:
     `curl -X POST  https://<gerrit-url>/changes/<change_to_test>/check.submit_requirement?sr-name=Foo&refs-config-change-id=$id`

* [Change 336715](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336715):
Disallow index updates that both add and remove fields

  A new version may only add or remove fields, but not both. The type of
  existing fields may not be changed.

* [Change 341454](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/341454):
Allow using GitWeb with multi-site and cached-refdb

* [Change 307349](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/307349):

Add a REST endpoint to list submit requirements in a project.

* [Change ](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/):
New REST API for applying a fix from the request body to a patch set

* [Change 339555](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/339555):
The commit-msg hook ignores fixup and squash commits now.

  Fixup and squash commits will inherit the Change-id of the commit they
  are squashed into.

* [Issue 10168](https://crbug.com/gerrit/10168):
Fix broken links to Gitweb lightweight tags

* [Issue 12546](https://crbug.com/gerrit/12546):
In commit-msg hook, the Change-Id is now inserted before any Signed-off-by

* [Issue 13930](https://crbug.com/gerrit/13930):
Support ssh kex server-sig-algs for modern clients, like OpenSSH 8.8

Disallow truncating the Change-Id across patch-sets

* [Issue 15997](https://crbug.com/gerrit/15664):
Make DelegateRepository#delegate() method public

* [Issue 16182](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16182):
Display the change's Change-Id underneath the commit message when not present in the commit message

* [Issue 16263](https://crbug.com/gerrit/16263):

Fix change screen errors when trying to load an invalid project with an exixting change number

* [Change 338680](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/338680):
Included copied/outdated votes in change message on patch set creation

  Include copied and outdated approvals into the change message that is
  posted on patch set creation. This allows users to find the copied/outdated
  approvals for each patch set in the change log.

* [Change 337968](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337968):
Copy approvals that are applied on outdated patch sets to follow-up patch sets if copyable

  Copying approvals that are applied on outdated patch sets to follow-up
  patch sets make the life easier for CIs, e.g.:

  1. CI is triggered on PS X
  2. While the CI is running, PS X+1 which only modified the commit
     message is uploaded
  3. CI finishes on votes Verified+1 on the outdated PS X

* [Change 336712](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336712):
Included outdated approvals in push output when pushing a new patch set

* [Change 336414](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336414):

  When a change becomes unsubmittable users want to know which submit
  requirements are no longer satisfied.

* [Change ](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/):
Support deletion of missing changes from the index

  If a change is not found, and the "delete_missing" option is set to
  "true", then try to delete it from the index.

* [Change 336134](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/336134):
gerrit.sh: add --debug option, start JVM in debug mode

* [Change 335754](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/335754):
Approver is added to the attention set when their approval is not copied

  If a user applied an approval on a change and this approval gets
  outdated and removed when a new patch set is uploaded (i.e. the approval
  is not copied to the new patch set) then this user is added to the
  attention set now. This is to signal that this user should re-review the
  change and renew their approval.

* [Change 330407](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/330407):
Added the value "NOT_EVALUATED" to the SubmitRequirementExpressionInfo in the Change API and in NoteDb.

  changes or on user changing user preferences.

* [Change 337421](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/337421):
Introduce Auto Dark/Light Theme based on OS preference

  Introducing a new default mode - Auto. This will dynamically change
  theme based on OS preferences. Mac OS has Auto mode, that switch

## Bugfix releases

### 3.7.4 (In development)

* Breaking changes

  * [Issue 40015585](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40015585):
  Enhance metric name sanitize function to remove collision on '_' between metrics.

    Collision between the sanitized metric names can be easily
    created e.g. `foo_bar` will collide with `foo+bar`. In order
    to avoid collisions keep the rules about slashes, replace not
    supported chars with `_0x[HEX CODE]_` string , the
    replacement prefix `0x` is prepended with another replacement prefix.

* New Features

  * [Change 377794](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/377794):
  Extend configurability of index pagination type

    Add NONE option to disable index backend pagination, this option
    needs to be honoured by the indexing backend and this change introduces
    the correct implementation for Lucene.

* Bug Fixes

  * [Change 378558](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/378558):
  Preserve refs order in the GitBatchRefUpdateEvent event

    Change I79eefbee introduced the concept of the single event
    representing batch ref update. However this new event doesn't
    preserve original order of the updated refs. This impacts event
    consumers behaviour and can cause failures. For example if meta
    ref is processed before patchset ref indexing operation will
    fail because of the missing patchset.

    To make sure that refs order is preserved and backward compatibility
    is kept use LinkedHashSet instead of HashSet.

  * [Issue 40015399](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40015399):
  We removed automatic linkification of URLs that do not start with https?://

  * [Issue 288303235](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/288303235):
  Fix search duplicates returned for imported changes upon  edits and reindexing

    When parsing the change data from ChangeNotes, the in-memory
    ChangeData created contains useful information like the serverId
    that the change belongs to. The same information isn't there when
    reindexing directly from a newly created entity Change which has
    no relationship with the underlying change notes.

    If the change to reindex is coming from a different server, it
    has a specific serverId associated which is needed for producing
    the correct virtualId for reindexing, that is the reason why
    it is crucial to have the serverId upon reindexing.

    Failing to propagate the original serverId for a change would result
    in generating duplicates during reindex:
    - The original document with the virtualId associated with the serverId
      of the change
    - A new document with the change number used as id.

    Make sure to reindex the same document by propagating the correct
    serverId of the change upon reindexing.

    Leverage the ability to index either local or imported changes
    in the following end-to-end use-cases:
    - Editing a change (create, amend or delete)
    - Indexing a change via REST-API
    - Staleness checker

    Amend also the ChangeIndexer.index(Change) JavaDoc by specifying
    that it is intended to be used only for local changes and therefore
    flag the method as deprecated.

    All references to ChangeIndexer.index(Change) are removed from Gerrit,
    however there could be plugins using the method which would need amending.

  * [Change 377536](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/377536):
  Clarify that index.cacheQueryResultsByChangeNum must be set to false for imported changes

    When importing changes from other Gerrit servers, the
    index.cacheQueryResultsByChangeNum must be set to false, otherwise

  Fix parsing legacy labels for users with comma

    where a UUID was present together with a user name containing a comma.

  Fix parsing of identities for imported accounts

    Change I2f017af1cbb introduced the ability to resolve accounts by
    imported external identities.

    Not every consumer of account identities however were accounting for
    imported accounts (i.e. changeNoesCache, AuditLogReader, etc).

    The consequence of this is that REST APIs (/accounts/ for example),
    were returning the _original_ imported account id rather than the one
    associated in the new server.

    Because of this, the UI might either show anonymous coward (when the
    original user id does not exist in the new server) or an erroneous user
    (where the original id maps to a different user on the new server).

    Fix this by parsing identities in a way that is aware of imported
    accounts.

  * [Issue 40015611](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40015611):
  Fix identity parsing for imported human comments

    When parsing human comments, noteDb data was just deserialized without
    validating the author identity.

    Whilst this is fine for changes that originated in the current Gerrit
    instance, this logic breaks when dealing with changes that were imported
    from a different server, since the user who made the comment is now
    mapped to a different user id.

    Parse author identities from comments so that their user id is correctly
    mapped to the identity for the current Gerrit server.

  * [Issue 40015148](https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40015148):
  Fix ExternalId differential loading when cache is inconsistent

    JGit may return a failure to update a repository, even if it actually
    succeeded.

    This can create an issue when loading externalIds, since
    we would retry to insert the same value into the cache twice,
    due to the retry performed by the client, leading the cache
    loader to consistently blow up.

    For example:
    Ext-Id1:
    * attempt to insert into All-Users: failed on JGit but not on disk [1]
    * the key Ext-Id1 is stored in cache
    Ext-Id1:
    * retry to insert into All-Users, because of JGit failure
    * try to add key Ext-Id1 entry BUT it already exists in cache => BOOM

    Make differential loading idempotent to avoid failures due to retry to
    insert the same entry again.

    Make "buildAllExternalIds" package-private for testing visibility.

  Fix internal server error caused by double flush in BaseCommand.TaskThunk

    Ignore `SshChannelClosedException` when flushing the task's output and error
    streams. JGit commands like `UploadPack` flush these streams already. When
    `TaskThunk` tries to flush them again `SshChannelClosedException` is thrown
    and led to an internal server error.

  AndSource: Run `isVisibleToPredicate` based on its cost

    The `isVisible` check can be expensive and always running it ahead of other

    estimated cost.

  Improved performance of queries when backend index returns more results than needed

    Matching changes more than the limit is just extra work that is discarded at
    the end when the results are trimmed to match the limit. This can help improve
    the performance of queries where a small percentage of changes are filtered
    in the initial page and the remaining results are obtained from the next page.

  * [Change 356215](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit/+/356215):
  Support `init --reindex-threads=-1` to skip reindexing after init.

    Admins may wish to run other commands after `init` and before `reindex`, but
    previously would have needed to observe and interrupt the `init` command
    process once it started reindexing in order to do so. Providing an option to
    `init` that skips the reindexing phase simplifies that workflow and makes it
    less error prone.
