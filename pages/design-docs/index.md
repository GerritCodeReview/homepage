Gerrit follows a design-driven contribution process for larger/complex features described
[here](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-contributing.html#design-driven-contribution-process).

This section houses design documents that were written prior to a system refactoring or the
introduction of a new feature.
The list is sorted by recency and links to individual design documents. Review and vetting of the
documents can be found in Gerrit by using the link inside each doc.
