# Solution 1 - Implementation

TBD.

List of questions that this design has to answer (suggestions for more are welcome):

*   Where is the attention set stored?
*   Will updates be atomic with other metadata changes?
*   What is the data structure for the attention set and its entries?
*   How does the REST API look like for attention set related operations?
*   How is the rule engine implemented?
*   How are we hooking up into relevant events?
*   How can custom rules be define on a per-repo basis?
*   How can plugins contribute custom conditions?
*   How is the attention set indexed and what are the supported search operators?
*   How are hosts migrated from assignee/reviewed based workflow to being attention set based?
