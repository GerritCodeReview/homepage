# Design Doc - Support posting changes from Jujutsu

The Jujutsu team has reached out to us to see whether Gerrit could support
Change-Id's that are stored as Git commit headers (also see
[here](/design-docs/support-jujutsu-use-cases.html#background)). This design doc
is a summary of the
[discussion](https://discord.com/channels/775374026587373568/775374026587373571/1355110156547002522)
that we had on Discord (special thanks to Remo and Martin from the Jujutsu team
to reach out to us, answer our questions and find solutions together with us).
