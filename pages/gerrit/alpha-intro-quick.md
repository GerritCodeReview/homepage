Gerrit is a web-based code review tool built on top of the [Git version
control system](https://git-scm.com/). This introduction provides an
overview of Gerrit and describes how Gerrit integrates into a typical
development workflow. It also provides a brief tutorial that shows how
to manage a change using Gerrit.

## What is Gerrit?

Gerrit makes code review easy by providing a lightweight framework for
reviewing commits before they are accepted by the codebase. Gerrit works
equally well for projects where approving changes is restricted to
selected users, as is typical for Open Source software development, as
well as projects where all contributors are trusted.
